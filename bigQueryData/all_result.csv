Summary - 

* Many lines of inquiry remain, some of which have been addressed only in part and others not at all.
* More than 30 key witnesses that the Committee has yet to interview. Includes those who never responded to interview request, witnesses that the Majority did not agree to call in for testimony or request docs from, and other pertinent new witnesses discovered recently.
* The Committee has more than 20 entities from which they were unable to request documents before the investigation was shutdown: including Deutsche Bank, the Estate of Peter Smith (and associated entities), the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce in the USA, and social media companies. 
* Appendix D outlines more than 15 persons and entities for which the Committee believes compulsory process for appearance and/or document production to the Committee is necessary. Included are witnesses who have refused to appear; who have invoked a nonexistent privilege to avoid pertinent testimony or who have simply refused to answer questions because the answers may be adverse to the interests of the President or his campaign; who have not produced any documentation; or whose production was insufficient and for whom we have a reasonable basis to believe that they possess documents responsive to the Committee’s investigation. This list includes, among others: Donald Trump Jr., Michael Cohen, Jared Kushner, Hope Hicks, Attorney General Sessions, Erik Prince, and the White House. The Committee must also initiate a contempt process to compel Stephen Bannon to testify to the Committee fully and without constraints.


Also...

&gt; The Minority sent a document request on March 7,
2018 to **Reddit** and Tumblr, which the Majority declined to join. 

Iiiinteresting....

*****

**TLDR:** The Committee had a shitload more questions to answer, a ton of people to interview, and a fuck load of documents to obtain. It seems the Majority on the Committee blockaded and obstructed at every opportunity, and provided cover for those being investigated to find ways to avoid scrutiny.

11,"&gt; DNC is hacked in April (according to Trump's intelligence community, by the GRU).

That is according to crowd strike. The 17 IC all saying Russia is a blatant repeated lie. The report put out was intentionally misleading using weasel language. They said """"we believe"""" and are """"consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts"""". So in other non weasel word, we dont fucking know.

Here is what we DO know. 

The DNC refused to turn over the servers to the FBI.

They altered the DATA before copying it THEN turned it over.

The person leaking the emails, who you guys call a """"Russian agent"""" has never been wrong or had to retract anything has said it was leaked. (I know this doesnt mean fuck all to you)

Trump wanted to work WITH Russia since before this """"hack"""", and so did the voters. We can see the EUs direction and dont like it.

Manafort, like everyone is Washington has a long list of contacts. You need to make a case other then """"he had contact"""". That doesnt mean fuck all. He doesnt even have the capacity to enact or get rid of sanctions and he got fucking canned.

39,"You can watch the timeline of events from the DNC leak and how they formed this narrative after they lost to save face. There is undoubtedly some connections between some people close to Trump and Russia, but that isnt illegal. Using the same parameters you label """"collusion"""" and """"treason"""" we can arrest 90% of the politicians in D.C. 

I believe whole heartily the Collusion narrative is created completely by the DNC for the 2018 elections. Because they were able to blame the loss on the leaks, and Trump's affinity for Russia and respect of Putin they created this boogey man over night. Not only does this narrative alleviate all the blame that should fall squarely on the DNC it gives them a rock solid reason why they had surveillance on Trump's associates during the election and a battle cry to try to rustle up support for a committee in shambles. They went from untrustworthy cheaters with disdain for their constituents and their choices to this benevolent force fighting this heinous treasonous act with the flip of a switch.

Overnight we went from noone can topple our strong democracy being repeated from every news outlet to Facebook ADS are breaking the very fabric of our democracy, its insane. This is all a rich mans trick to keep people in power they want. What we have now, what this community is, and the hordes of people who see Russian behind every comment and every news story are simply the last kicks of a dying animal. The benevolent line didn't work, the other side is racist line didn't work, billions of dollars didn't work, fingers in every MSM outlet didn't work. So they said fuck it, there is a reason this wasn't a issue before they lost. 

This is the only line they could of taken without looking like wannabe dictators abusing the IC to retain power. This is the only line that minimizes the humiliating loss. This is the only line that makes fucking Podesta and the DNC look like poor victims and its the only line that had a chance of saving face. They know Trump has business ties all over picked this one because of the left over cold war feelings and fucking ran with it. 

At the end of the day, the think tank that thought this up really is fucking brilliant and I cant blame them after such a humiliating loss. And to be honest with you, Trump is a fucking idiot and resorting to this as the only way to take him down is truly pathetic.

Sessions (and his recusal) is the only thing standing between Trump and escaping accountability. 

What should happen at the end of the investigation? Should the results be locked away in a drawer never to be seen or should congress get to see the findings? The Special Counsel (Mueller) reports his findings to the AG (Sessions) and **the AG has sole authority to determine if we ever see the results of the investigation**.

But if Sessions is replaced with someone without a recusal, as the new AG, it would have the same effect as Rosenstein being fired.

&gt;As the reason for all this is truly brilliant scheme that solves a very multi-faceted problem. First and foremost it gains votes, his entire platform is about America first and this is a great way to throw shade on that. Second, not one peep ever again about the massive amounts of corruption that was revealed form the leaks. Third, they were able to use these findings as more ammo to start the special counsel that is going to carry on the charade all the way up until midterms. Fourth, they are able to focus in on the investigation in the media and not actually policy changes.

&gt;And thats just the domestic and political benefits the left can get from this. I dont really want to get into to much about how this is shaping the current situation in the middle east because it will really out myself for the conspiracy theorist I am.

&gt;I dont think Don Jr will accept any deal ever regardless of what anyone puts in-front of him. To be frank about it, I dont like the guy. I think hes a moron and acts like a idiot on a day to day basis. He is the quintessential trust fund douche bag and would be shit posting on twitter until the day the feds kick in his door if he actually did commit a crime.

&gt;Totally wrong. Crowdstrike is an official FBI contractor, and the DNC and FBI mutually agreed to using them.

&gt;Crowd strike had a previous contract worth 150k from july 2015-16. Its for some work unrelated to this investigation. The FBI repeatedly asked for access to the server to investigate and were rebuffed. We know this from Comey's own testimony. Stop saying Official FBI contractor like it means anything important, they dont answer to the public they answer to the investors as they are a private company hired by the DNC.

&gt;You know all this. You are just muddying the waters because you dont have a good reason for them not to turn it over. This raises monumental concern because we are shaping geopolitical policy based on a private companies word. We have a FBI for a reason, the minute they refused to let them investigate is the minute I dont give a fuck what they find. There is only one real reason to take these actions, to find what they want not what actually happened.

&gt;So my turn for a question. How would you feel if Trump hired a Private company to investigate his Russian connections and they found """"nothing"""". Would you expect people to accept those findings?

&gt;That is according to crowd strike. The 17 IC all saying Russia is a blatant repeated lie. The report put out was intentionally misleading using weasel language. They said """"we believe"""" and are """"consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts"""". So in other non weasel word, we dont fucking know.

&gt;Here is what we DO know.

&gt;The DNC refused to turn over the servers to the FBI.

&gt;They altered the DATA before copying it THEN turned it over.

&gt;The person leaking the emails, who you guys call a """"Russian agent"""" has never been wrong or had to retract anything has said it was leaked. (I know this doesnt mean fuck all to you)

&gt;Trump wanted to work WITH Russia since before this """"hack"""", and so did the voters. We can see the EUs direction and dont like it.

&gt;Manafort, like everyone is Washington has a long list of contacts. You need to make a case other then """"he had contact"""". That doesnt mean fuck all. He doesnt even have the capacity to enact or get rid of sanctions and he got fucking canned.

&gt;Imagine that everything I just said applied to Hillary Clinton and Saudi Arabia.

&gt;You mean like a Saudi owned bank picking a entire cabinet? Fucking lol. Fucking imagine if you had a verifiable email of a Russian owned company picking Trump's entire cabinet.

&gt;Routine actions are treason for Trump. Provable corruption is routine for the left. The accusation hinge on the word of the DNC, remember that. That is what crowd strike is. Do you really want to put your trust in them?

very big or don't make too much noise. 


I can almost guarantee that a subreddit of this size has at least one
neoliberal """"anti-hate speech"""" mod to make sure that no one says
anything too out of line. This happens as a subreddit grows in
size/influence, like r/bestof, various gaming subs around the time of
gamergate, various news-related subs and even smaller politics and
philosophy subs; sometimes they will even install an admin as a
mod against the wishes of subreddit members, or refuse to remove
an admin mod, since admins have extra moderation tools that can
silence critics and the other mods.

182,"Your theory hinges on one critical flaw you consistently over look. Russia did not hack the DNC, it was leaked by a insider. You operate like that has been proven but everything points to the opposite. All the bullshit about the 17 agencies is completely laughable. The amount of influence being asserted to twist these heads to issue statements based on bullshit is astounding really. We can start at the very beginning with the initial lie by james clapper that gets toted around as its some kind of proof.

&gt;""""The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.""""

This was a deliberate deceptive message. It implied that the all 16 intelligence agencies agreed with the premise and “evidence of Russian meddling. Yet not a single bit of proof was offered. More telling was the absence of any written document issued from the Office of the DNI that detailed the supposed intel backing up this judgment. 

Notice the weasel language in this release:
&gt;The USIC is **confident**
&gt;We **believe** . . .

If there was actual evidence/intelligence, such as an intercepted conversation between Vladimir Putin and a subordinate ordering them to hack the DNC or even a human source report claiming such an activity, then it would have and should have been referenced in the Clapper/Johnson document. It was not because such intel did not exist.

Then Hillary Clinton helped perpetuate this myth during the late October debate with Donald Trump, when she declared as fact that:
&gt;""""We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,"""" Clinton said. """"I find that deeply disturbing.”

What is shocking is that there was so little pushback to this nonsense. Hardly anyone asked why would the DEA, Coast Guard, the Marines or DOE have any technical expertise to make a judgment about Russian hacking of U.S. election systems.  And no one of any importance asked the obvious—where was the written memo or National Intelligence Estimate laying out what the IC supposedly knew and believed? There was **nothing**.


 The document produced in January 2017 was not a genuine work reflecting the views of the “Intelligence Community.” It only represented the supposed thinking (and I use that term generously) of CIA, NSA and FBI analysts. In other words, only three of 16 agencies cleared on the document that presented four conclusions:

&gt;Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.

&gt;We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. 
 
&gt;We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes.

Sounds pretty ominous, but the language used tells a different story. The conclusions are based on assumptions and judgments. There was nor is any actual evidence from intelligence sources showing that Vladimir Putin ordered up anything or that his government preferred Trump over Clinton.


So in conclusion the Intelligence Community was used as a tool to misinform the public and persuade them that Russia was guilty of something they did not do. That lie remains unchallenged. Its not a conspiracy theory it is right fucking there in front of us, its a fact. 

**you** **are** **the** **one** **peddling** **conspiracy** **theories** **I** **am** **following** **facts**

No, this is not an example of whataboutism.

249,"Im just going to copy paste my comment on them from last week. All sourced and their own methodology section is where a lot of the information comes from.


But lets get down to the brass tax here about the Russian bots being reported here. They are basing their story on a times [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/technology/russian-bots-school-shooting.html) , they are doing no investigating of their own so were just going to fall back to the times article to see where the source of this information is coming from. The times article is using information fed to them by the """"Alliance for securing democracy"""" and their """"Hamilton 68 dashboard"""". Here is a link to their own site that explains their [methodology section](http://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/blog/2017/08/02/hamilton-68-new-tool-track-russian-disinformation-twitter) on where they explain how they determine what is being pushed by Russian bots. There entire dashboard is based around 600 accounts they deemed Russian propaganda accounts. How did they do that you ask? Lets have a look.

&gt;We identified these accounts through three different methods. First, we tracked disinformation campaigns that synchronized with overt Russian propaganda outlets like Sputnik and RT (Russia Today). We analyzed the social networks of users who were promoting this disinformation to identify which users were centrally involved, and to remove users who tweeted disinformation casually, after encountering it online.

&gt;Second, we identified a group of users online that openly professed to be pro-Russian and tweeted primarily in support of Russian government policies and themes. We analyzed followers of these accounts to identify a large and interconnected social network that tweeted the same themes and content.

&gt;Third, we identified accounts that appear to use automation to boost the signal of other accounts linked to Russian influence operations. We assessed this group by looking at accounts that had disproportionately large numbers of interactions with other accounts (including sending and receiving retweets) along with a very high number of tweets per day. These accounts may be bots, meaning a piece of computer code that tweets automatically based on pre-determined rules, or they may be cyborgs, meaning that some of their activity is automated, which is then manually supplemented by a human user.

The entire methodology is critically flawed and hinges solely on what they deem """"Russian talking points"""". So now the question would be who is """"they"""" a what are they using to determine are """"Russian talking points"""". So now let explore that avenue shall we?

Lets start with the [source](https://theintercept.com/2017/07/17/with-new-d-c-policy-group-dems-continue-to-rehabilitate-and-unify-with-bush-era-neocons/) I am using for this. The organization is being run by two prominent figures who are Laura Rosenberger, and Jamie fly. Laura served as a foreign policy adviser for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and chief of staff to two Obama national security officials. And Jamie whos one of the most notorious neocons in Washington famous for his criticizing of Obama for not using MORE military action in Iran. This is a man who, to put it bluntly, gets paid on the back of dead soldiers and war.

Now lets move on  to the board of directors.

* Jake Sullivan - national security adviser to Joe Biden and the Clinton campaign

* Mike Morrell - Obama’s acting CIA director

* Mike McFaul - Obama’s ambassador to Russia

* Mike Chertoff - Bush’s homeland security secretary

* Mike Rogers - the far-right, supremely hawkish former congressman who now hosts a right-wing radio show

* Bill Kristol - you know who he is. 
 

&gt;In sum — just as was true of the first Cold War, when neocons made their home among the Cold Warriors of the Democratic Party — on the key foreign policy controversies, there is now little to no daylight between leading Democratic Party foreign policy gurus and the Bush-era neocons who had wallowed in disgrace following the debacle of Iraq and the broader abuses of the war on terror. That’s why they are able so comfortably to unify this way in support of common foreign policy objectives and beliefs.

So we have a all star team of neocons and democrats who worked along side Clinton and Obama. These people profit off of instability and war and are about the FARTHEST thing you can get from a impartial point of view of this situation. Their methodology uses no real proof so they can sculpt and mold what the """"Russians"""" are attacking.

Mueller III, has subpoenaed the Trump Organization to turn over documents, including some related to Russia, according to two people briefed on the matter. **The order is the first known time that the special counsel demanded documents directly related to President Trump’s businesses, bringing the investigation closer to the president.**
&gt; 
&gt; The breadth of the subpoena was not clear, nor was it clear why Mr. Mueller issued it instead of simply asking for the documents from the company, an umbrella organization that oversees Mr. Trump’s business ventures. **In the subpoena, delivered in recent weeks, Mr. Mueller ordered the Trump Organization to hand over all documents related to Russia and other topics he is investigating**, the people said.
&gt; 
&gt; **The subpoena is the latest indication that the investigation, which Mr. Trump’s lawyers once regularly assured him would be completed by now, will drag on for at least several more months. Word of the subpoena comes as Mr. Mueller appears to be broadening his investigation to examine the role foreign money may have played in funding Mr. Trump’s political activities. In recent weeks, Mr. Mueller’s investigators have questioned witnesses, including an adviser to the United Arab Emirates, about the flow of Emirati money into the United States.**
&gt; 
&gt; Neither White House officials nor Alan S. Futerfas, a lawyer representing the Trump Organization, immediately responded to requests for comment. The Trump Organization has typically complied with requests from congressional investigators for documents for their own inquiries into Russian election interference, and there was no indication the company planned to fight Mr. Mueller about it.
&gt; 
&gt; The Trump Organization has said that it never had real estate holdings in Russia, but witnesses recently interviewed by Mr. Mueller have been asked about a possible real estate deal in Moscow. In 2015, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump’s emailed Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, at his Trump Organization account claiming he had ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and said that building a Trump Tower in Moscow would help Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Mueller could run afoul of a line the president has warned him not to cross. Though it is not clear how much of the subpoena is related to Mr. Trump’s business beyond ties to Russia, Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in July that the special counsel would be crossing a “red line” if he looked into his family’s finances beyond any relationship with Russia. The president declined to say how he would respond if he concluded that the special counsel had crossed that line.
&gt; 
&gt; A month before Mr. Trump spoke of his red line, the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to quit after Mr. Trump asked him to have Mr. Mueller fired because the president believed he had conflict-of-interest issues that precluded him from running the special counsel investigation.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Mueller was appointed in May to investigate whether Mr. Trump’s campaign colluded with the Russians to influence the 2016 presidential election and any other matters that may arise from the inquiry. He is also examining whether the president has tried to obstruct the investigation.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Trump’s lawyers are in negotiations with Mr. Mueller’s office about whether and how to allow his investigators to interview the president. Mr. Mueller’s office has shared topics it wants to discuss with the president, according to two people familiar with the talks. The lawyers have advised Mr. Trump to refuse an interview but the president wants to do it, as he believes he has done nothing wrong and can easily answer investigators’ questions.
&gt; 
&gt; At the same time, Mr. Trump is considering whether to bring on a new lawyer to help represent him in the special counsel’s investigation. Last week, Mr. Trump spoke with Emmet Flood, a longtime Washington lawyer who represented former President Bill Clinton during the impeachment process, about coming into the White House to deal with the inquiry.",,HaLoGuY007,37,t3_84offn,dvr30fx,t3_84offn,t5_3jjnn,1521137289

Last December, amid the jumbled Republican presidential nomination scrum, Donald Trump carved out a half an hour for a live video interview with a volcanic Austin radio and web-streaming host who broadcasts from a semi-secret location dubbed “The Central Texas Command Center and the Heart of the Resistance.”

Alex Jones, America’s foremost purveyor of outlandish conspiracy theories, was in a buoyant mood that day. He’d had Matt Drudge, the influential conservative news aggregator, on recently. But this was much bigger.

Trump wasted no time signaling that his mind-set aligned with the host’s. Trump said he wouldn’t apologize for asserting that large numbers of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated the collapse of the twin towers in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a claim that fact-checkers have repeatedly refuted.

“People like you and I can’t do that so easily,” the New York developer, speaking from his office in Trump Tower, said. He would later call Jones “a nice guy.”

The December interview would reverberate into the general election as Hillary Clinton tried to use it to paint Trump as an irresponsible crackpot associating with an irresponsible crackpot. It also pushed Jones, who operates the websites Infowars.com and Prisonplanet.com, from the realm of niche showman into the mainstream national dialogue. The man who said that the Newtown, Conn., school shooting was a “hoax” involving child actors and claimed that elements of the U.S. government were responsible for bombing the Oklahoma City federal building and for the 9/11 attacks had been granted an enormous new audience.

“I think Alex Jones may be the single most important voice in the alternative conservative media,” says Roger Stone, the Nixon-era political trickster who orchestrated Trump’s appearance on the show.

On Monday, Trump seemed to confirm Jones’s status. Jones says Trump called to promise he would return to the program to thank the Infowars audience, an extraordinary gesture for an incoming president whose schedule is packed with calls from world leaders and the enormous task of overseeing the transition. The president-elect’s team hasn’t confirmed that the conversation took place.

&gt;If there's reason for something like this to be investigated, it must go on.

The reason something """"like this"""" is being investigated is quite clear. Its unelected officials forcing the hand by any means necessary. Why did Obama need to put the FISA judge there right before the investigation? Why were stzork and page put on the team? Why did they have a personal relationship with the FISA judge who was JUST placed there? Why did he approve the warrant take the PLEA then recuse himself?  Why did comey lie under oath?

But you never responded to the evidence I provided that Russian interference into the American election was not a hoax. Special Counsel Mueller's indictment of 13 Russian Nationals and 3 Russian Companies would have something else to say about that. 

These were your words;

&gt;The Russian bot obsession has passed from funny and desperate to worrying. Eventually they will be able to shut down all opposing view points by saying two simple words.

The Russian disinformation campaign continues while the current administration refuses to act upon a real threat, President Trump has failed to give instructions to the NSA to disrupt Russian election meddling.^[[1]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/27/trump-russia-meddling-mike-rogers) They have a long history of promoting disinformation campaigns in an attempt to destabilize the West and America, there is historical precedence.^[[2]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/us/politics/russian-disinformation-aids-fake-news.html) The parallels between what is happening now and what occurred in Ukraine in 2014 are uncanny in nature and should worry every sane American and Westerner.^[[3]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/inside-a-russian-disinformation-campaign-in-ukraine-in-2014/2017/12/25/f55b0408-e71d-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html?utm_term=.f20b9d1d4710)

This was an extremely sophisticated operation, I recommend reading the indictment as it is only 37 pages long, below I have included a few excerpts.^[[4]](https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download) They bought political ads on social media in the names of US persons. All of this was funded through Russian fronts, including a catering company run by a Russian national known as """"Putin's chef"""". Prigozhin has been Putin's go to guy for under the table missions, including recruiting mercenaries for the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.^[[5]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/world/europe/prigozhin-russia-indictment-mueller.html) We just found out that Prigozhin gave the go ahead for Assad forces and Russian mercenaries to attack a US base in Syria a few weeks ago.^[[7]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/putin-ally-said-to-be-in-touch-with-kremlin-assad-before-his-mercenaries-attacked-us-troops/2018/02/22/f4ef050c-1781-11e8-8b08-027a6ccb38eb_story.html?utm_term=.d1afa2db0fbf)

Russian operatives used stolen US identities, travelled across 9 states collecting intelligence, discussed escape routes if they were caught inside the country, bought equipment including burner phones/SIM cards. This operation included hundreds of employees conducting information warfare during the election, it was funded with millions of dollars from the Kremlin. 


&gt;**Object of the Conspiracy;**

&gt; 28.. The conspiracy had as its object impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful government functions of the United States by dishonest means in order to enable the Defendants to interfere with US political and electoral processes, including the 2016 US presidential election.  

&gt;**Manner and Means of the Conspiracy:**

&gt; 29.. Starting at least in or around 2014, Defendants and their co-conspirators began to track and study groups on US social media sites dedicated to US politics and social issues. In order to gauge the performance of various groups on social media sites, the ORGANIZATION tracked certain metrics like the group's size, the frequency of content places by the group, and the level of audience engagement with that content, such as the average number of comments or responses to  a post. 



&gt;a. KRYLOVA and BOGACHEVA, together with other defendants and co-conspirators, planned travel itineraries, purchases equipment (such as cameras, SIM cards, and drop phones), and discussed security measures (including """"evacuation scenarios"""") for Defendants who traveled to the United States. 


&gt;**Use of US Social Media Platforms**

&gt;32.. Defendants and their co-conspirators, through fraud and deceit, created hundres of social media accounts and used them to develop certain fictitious US personas into """"leader[s] of public opinion"""" in the United States. 

&gt;**Use of US Computer Infrastructure**

&gt;39.. To hide their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, Defendants and their co-conspirators - particularly POLOZOV and the ORGANIZATION's IT department - purchases space on computer servers located inside the United States in order to set up virtual private networks (""""VPNs""""). Defendants and their co-conspirators connected from Russia to the US based infrastructure by way of these VPNs and conducted activity inside the United Sates - including accessing online social media accounts, opening new accounts, and communicated with real US persons - while masking the Russian origin and control of the activity. 

&gt;40.. Defendants and their co-conspirators also registered and controlled hundreds of web-based email accounts hosted by US email providers under false names so as to appear to be US persons and groups. From these accounts, Defendants and their co-conspirators registered or linked to online social media accounts in order to monitor them; posed as US persons when requesting assistance from real US persons; contacted media outlets in order to promote activities inside the United States; and conducted other operations, such as those set forth below. 

&gt;**Use of Stolen US Identities**

&gt;41.. In or around 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators also uses, possessed, and transferred, without lawful authority, the social security numbers and dates of birth of real US persons without those persons' knowledge or consent. Using these means of identification, Defendants and their co-conspirators opened accounts at PayPal, a digital payment service provider; created false means of identification, including fake driver's licenses; and posted on ORGANIZATION - controlled social media accounts using the identities of these US victims. 

&gt;**Actions Targeting the 2016 US Presidential Election**

&gt;42.. By approximately May 2014, Defendants and their co-conspirators discussed efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. Defendants and their co-conspirators began to monitor US social media accounts and other sources of information about the 2016 US presidential election. 

&gt;43.. By 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used their fictitious online personas to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election. They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump. 

&gt;45.. Defendants and their co-conspirators also used false US personas to communicate with unwitting members, volunteers, and supporters of the Trump Campaign involved in local community outreach, as well as grassroots groups that supported then-candidate Trump. These individuals and entities at times distributed the ORGANIZATION's materials through their own accounts via retweets, reposts, and similar means. Defendants and their co-conspirators then monitored the propagation of content through such participants. 

&gt;46.. In or around the latter half of 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, through their ORGANIZATION-controlled personas, began to encourage US minority groups not to vote in the 2016 US presidential election or to vote for a third-party US presidential candidate. 

&gt;47.. Starting in or around the summer of 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators also began to promote allegations of voter fraud by the Democratic Party through their fictitious US personas and groups on social media. Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased advertisements on Facebook to further promote the allegations. 

&gt;**Political Advertisements**

&gt;48.. From at least April 2016 through November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, while concealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation through false personas, began to produce, purchase, and post advertisements on US social media and other online sites expressly advocating for the election of then-candidate Trump or expressly opposing Clinton. Defendants and their co-conspirators did not report their expenditures to the Federal Election Commission, or register as foreign agents with the US Department of Justice.

Inside was a sealed letter from the Russian autocrat. What the letter said has never been revealed.**

The Agalarovs brought Trump a box from Putin himself. Did it also contain a tape?

There was another Trump Tower meeting before he announced he was running for president.

&gt; Frequently, Trump would toss out finalists and replace them with others he preferred. “If there were too many women of color, he would make changes,” a Miss Universe staffer later noted. Another Miss Universe staffer recalled, “He often thought a woman was too ethnic or too dark-skinned. He had a particular type of woman he thought was a winner. Others were too ethnic.

**Cadre** (a company Jared Kushner co-founded and left off his security clearance paperwork) is also in Peter Thiel’s portfolio. ^[[1]](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/donald-trump-peter-thiel-top-intelligence-advisory-post) Thiel, who was part of the Trump transition team, gained a role following his donation of more than a million dollars to Trump’s campaign within days of the Billy Bush tape release. ^[[2]](https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/11/13602026/peter-thiel-trump-transition-team-facebook)  
Bannon said of Thiel: 

&gt;“I cannot overstate his impact on the transition,” Bannon began, describing Thiel as a hidden hand in shaping Team Trump. “You will see in the near term that Peter will be taking on new responsibilities, like intelligence.” While Trump and his communications squad may rail about Washington’s permanent bureaucracy, especially those in national-security positions, Bannon talked about having been in the trenches alongside Thiel as part of an offensive against the so-called Deep State”^[[1]](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/donald-trump-peter-thiel-top-intelligence-advisory-post)  Although he doesn’t have an official post, Peter Thiel’s company Palantir was just awarded a $876 million U.S. Army contract. ^[[3]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-09/peter-thiel-s-palantir-wins-876-million-u-s-army-contract) 

Bannon wasn’t the only Breitbart employee interested in Thiel. He also initially had a connection to Milo Yiannopoulos.
&gt;Thiel invited the Breitbart tech editor for dinner at his Hollywood Hills home in June, a dinner Yiannopoulos boasted of the same night to Bannon: 

“You two should meet. … An obvious candidate for movie financing if we got external. … He has f#$%#d (Gawker Media founder Nick) Denton &amp; Gawker so many ways it brought a tear to my eye.” 

They made plans to meet during the July Republican National Convention. 

&gt;But much of Yiannopoulos’s knowledge of Thiel seemed to come secondhand from other right-wing activists, as well as Curtis Yarvin, the blogger who advocates the return of feudalism.  In an email exchange shortly after the election, Yarvin told Yiannopoulos that he had been “coaching Thiel.”  “Peter needs guidance on politics for sure,” Yiannopoulos responded. 
“Less than you might think!” Yarvin wrote back. 

&gt;“I watched the election at his house, I think my hangover lasted into Tuesday. He’s fully enlightened, just plays it very carefully.”  ^[[4]](https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism?utm_term=.thkzNmMRbR#.kmmz7AkOKO)

And there was that “Villains and Heroes” costume party/fundraiser that everyone all seemed to be at: 

“… Mr. Thiel dressed as Hulk Hogan for the “Villains and Heroes” annual costume party last month, hosted on Long Island by the Mercer Family, who were big trump donors.  He shows me a picture on his phone of him posing with **Erik Prince**, who founded Blackwater, and Mr. Trump - who had no costume” ^[[5]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/fashion/peter-thiel-donald-trump-silicon-valley-technology-gawker.html)

Thiel dressed as Hogan because he secretly funded Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker that was settled for $31 million. ^[[6]](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/02/hogan-thiel-gawker-trial/554132/)  Thiel is on Facebook’s board and “Zuckerberg has continually defended Thiel’s presence on Facebook’s governing body as vital to the company, a balancing presence to stop the site from sliding too far in any one political direction.” ^[[7]](https://nymag.com/selectall/2018/01/is-peter-thiel-playing-mark-zuckerberg.html) Thiel helped lead a meeting to calm down conservatives that believed they were being “censored” including: Glenn Beck, Tucker Carlson, Dana Perino, and leaders from the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute. ^[[7]](https://nymag.com/selectall/2018/01/is-peter-thiel-playing-mark-zuckerberg.html).  

 That meeting seemed to ease much of their concern. They seem pretty cozy in this Gizmodo article titled - """"Facebook Threw a Swanky Inauguration Party With Garbage Website The Daily Caller"""" ^[[8]](https://gizmodo.com/facebook-threw-a-swanky-inauguration-party-with-garbage-1791376499) This party boasted a guests including:  Laura Ingraham, Benny Johnson, Matt Boyle, Grover Norquist, Scooter Libby, and Martin Shkreli, who previously ran around with Alt-Right trolls and offered to bail out 4chan by joining it's board of directors.^[[9]](https://www.salon.com/2016/10/06/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-of-course-offers-to-bail-out-financially-troubled-4chan/)

**ALSO**

According to a statement [James Damore (ex-Googler) made to Joe Rogan  at (1:58:40)^[10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ1JeII0eGo) (Youtube) there’s an underground conservative network in Silicon Valley.
&gt;I didn’t know so much about the underground conservative network before all this… there’s so much verification you have to join one of these… because there’s active attempts to infiltrate the groups.

**AND**

Anthonly Scaramucci seems to agree with him because a new podcast from Recode.net is entitled: “Anthony ‘The Mooch’ Scaramucci: Trump has secret admirers in Silicon Valley” ^[[11]](https://www.recode.net/2018/3/19/17136200/anthony-scaramucci-mooch-donald-trump-reince-priebus-steve-bannon-kara-swisher-decode-podcast). By their own admission, sounds like there’s a connection here.

The finishing touches for this weird twist of characters some when Michael Cohen presented his side of the Stormy Daniel’s story in [Vanity Fair [^12]](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/michael-cohen-offers-his-side-of-the-stormy-daniels-saga)
&gt;In another Trumpian twist, **Charles Harder—the attorney best known for representing Hulk Hogan in his lawsuit against Gawker—is handling the case on behalf of Trump**.

They were also using it for ICE deportations

From internal emails from the Intercept article about this:

“I am going to see if our **Palantir** guy is here to dump the Western Union info in there since I know there is a way to triangulate the area he’s sending money from and narrow down time of day etc,” responded Jen Miller, an ICE agent on the email thread.
Palantir is a controversial data analytics firm co-founded by billionaire investor Peter Thiel. The company, which does business with the military and major intelligence agencies, has contracted with ICE since 2014. As journalist Spencer Woodman reported last year, the company developed a special system for ICE to access a vast “ecosystem” of data to facilitate immigration officials in both discovering targets and then creating and administering cases against them.

Second - the DNI video says literally nothing about this.  It's a threat without substance.  """"If you did this, you're in trouble.""""  In the immortal words of every fifth grader ever - duh.

Third - as to Turley's opinion piece,

So - in response:

1) [The recused Sessions violated his recusal to perform this firing](https://www.justsecurity.org/54037/sessions-firing-mccabe-violated-promise-recuse/) and [he has skin in the game to discredit mccabe](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/us/politics/jeff-sessions-special-counsel-russia.html).

2) [Trump made clear via tweet that the reasons weren't what Turley alleges.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/975163071361683456)  The reason was the witch hunt.  This is like firing someone for any other pretext - you can fire someone because they wear brightly colored shoes, but not because they're black.  The President's tweets absolutely say that it was the leaks but it ties it back to the Comey firing which, surprise surprise, puts the lie to your position. [ Trump admitted on TV that he fired Comey over the Russia thing](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/11/donald-trump-james-comey-firing-russia-investigation).  Oops.  He tied the firing of McCabe to the firing of Comey and by extension, the Russia thing.  Double oops.  So, not so much for Very Legitimate Reasons, more like a potentially defensible pretext.

3) [Trump's LAWYER made clear the same thing](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/17/politics/john-dowd-mueller-russia-investigation/index.html).  Ditto on defensible pretext.

4) Meanwhile, the """"very legitimate reasons"""" don't actually mean [what you think they mean, according to former FBI agent Asha Rangappa](https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/975169077110099969).  

Now, if you're an FBI agent (and if so, proof to the mods would be cool) then I'll trust you know what you're talking about.  If not? I'm not compelled by a partisan oped.

5) Meanwhile - as with the """"fire for their shoes but not their skin color"""" pretext issue - the evidence is weighted pretty heavily in favor of his having been fired for political reasons - because it must be read in conjunction with the timing - two days before his retirement, and [88 days after Trump's tweet setting a 90 day countdown timer](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/944666448185692166?lang=en) on McCabe running down the clock - furthering evidence that the firing was political, and not based on the """"very legitimate reasons"""" which are not yet known to the public.

The Podesta Group is either Company A or Company B. Mueller is protecting them. He didn't list the name of either company, and the indictment is worded in such a way to make it appear that the Podesta Group didn't actually know they were doing something wrong, and it was all on Manfort/Gates.

**EDIT: thanks for the downvotes guess I'm full of shit and so are the researchers that Congress consulted on this very issue...**

(you people are fucking ignorant)

&gt; When assessing the potential vulnerability of U.S. military forces and civilian critical 
infrastructures to EMP, it is necessary to be mindful of the complex interdependencies of these 
highly-networked systems, because EMP upset and damage of a very small fraction of the total 
system can cause total system failure.26
Real world failures of electric grids from various causes indicate that a nuclear EMP attack 
would have catastrophic consequences. Significant and highly disruptive blackouts have been 
caused by single-point failures cascading into system-wide failures, originating from damage 
comprising far less than 1 percent of the total system.

From their own methodology section.


&gt;We tracked disinformation campaigns that synchronized with overt Russian propaganda outlets like Sputnik and RT (Russia Today). We analyzed the social networks of users who were promoting this disinformation to identify which users were centrally involved, and to remove users who tweeted disinformation casually, after encountering it online.

&gt;We identified a group of users online who openly professed to be pro-Russian and tweeted primarily in support of Russian government policies and themes. We analyzed followers of these accounts to identify a large and interconnected social network that tweeted the same themes and content.

&gt;Not all content in this network is “created” by Russia. A significant amount—probably a majority—of content is created by third parties and then amplified by the network because it is relevant to Russian messaging themes.

&gt;Because of the two points above, we emphasize it is NOT CORRECT to describe sites linked by this network as Russian propaganda sites. We are not claiming that content producers linked by this network are Russian propaganda sites. Rather, content linked by this network is RELEVANT to Russian messaging themes.

Again more weasel tactics to find the connection you want but isnt there.

&gt; Because it is illegal for foreign nationals to spend money in U.S. campaigns, obscuring funds coming from, say, an agent of the Russian government — by funneling them through an organization like the NRA — would be akin to money laundering.

&gt; Growing evidence is showing that money from hidden sources could be influencing current political leaders via two avenues: through the obscured personal finances of the president, and other public officials; and through secret contributions to political organizations.

&gt; It has been widely reported that a vast amount of Russian money is tied up in President Donald Trump's assets and business interests — interests which Trump, breaking with longstanding precedent, refused to divest or put into a blind trust upon assuming office. Recent reports have shown that money continues to move into Trump-branded properties from obscured sources like anonymous LLCs and shell companies.

&gt; One such report found that since Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, the fraction of anonymous purchases of his properties through shell companies has """"skyrocketed"""" from 4 to 70 percent. The public can only guess at the source of these funds, whether they be foreign governments or wealthy domestic interests—and to what extent unknown sums pouring into other Trump businesses are being used to curry favor with the president.

&gt; Moreover, in the case of the NRA, the FBI is now investigating whether illicit funds were spent in support of Trump's political campaign. We have long warned that our broken system of campaign finance disclosure creates opportunities for foreign governments to illegally influence American elections, undetected.

&gt; The NRA is among the largest """"dark money"""" organizations, reporting the greatest amount of campaign spending without revealing the source of the funds — over $35 million in the 2016 election cycle alone. Still, this amount was just a fraction of the over $175 million in reported campaign-related spending that came from unknown sources.

&gt; As these examples demonstrate, the Russia investigation is not just relevant to allegations of collusion, or even just to Russia. It is revealing a fundamental vulnerability in our political system — one that is being exploited by Russia, but that is also being exploited by others, foreign and domestic, who want to see American government serve their interests instead of the interests of the American public.",,HaLoGuY007,7,t1_duhsecz,duhuiau,t3_7yn41c,t5_3jjnn,1519057132

&gt;The link to Ukrainian politics explains the less noted collusion between Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the government of Ukraine. Andrii Telizhenko, a political officer in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, said that during the 2016 campaign, other embassy officials “were coordinating an investigation with the Hillary team on Paul Manafort.” It might be worth investigating whether this constituted foreign interference in the U.S. election process abetted by Clinton’s team.

and this

&gt;“The Democrat-linked firm Fusion GPS actually took money from the Russian government while it created the phony dossier that’s been the basis for all of the Russia scandal""""

So you have the DNC paying for this dossier, using the dossier to obtain warrants, then using that information for political gain. So the DNC colluded with not one, two, but 3 foreign governments to write this piece of piss fan fiction then used their contacts in the FBI to abuse it. 

They then use these very same contacts of people who know THEY PAID for the dossier as the basis of a special counsel. Then you fill the special counsel with with the very same people who donate to the committee who PAID for the fucking dossier, its nuts.

The document itself was not central to the bureau's argument before a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that Page could have been acting as an agent of Russia, according to CNN.

&gt;But the raw intelligence contained in the 35-page collection of memos — written by the former British intelligence operative Christopher Steele, who spent 20 years spying for MI6 in Moscow — apparently helped the FBI convince the court that Page could be acting as an agent of a foreign power.

926,"Lets get a dose of reality here for people who still seem to think weaponizing the IC and fabricating evidence to subvert democracy and remove a sitting president isnt high treason. Lets start at the top.

&gt;Carter Page was under investigation for being a Russian Agent since 2013. Long before Trump even thought of being president

To renew a FISA warrant you need to present a case, his previous FISA warrants held ZERO weight when it comes time for renewal that is why they needed to fabricate new evidence.

&gt;The quote in the memo about Steele not wanting Trump to be president lacks context.

We have a full quote that really doesnt need context at all. Its very straight forward and completely shits on the line you people tote of """"prestigious British spy just trying to do good"""" Just another jaded money hungry idiot. 

&gt;During Steele's investigation he found evidence that Trump businesses and Jared Kushner businesses showed signs that money laundering was occurring. There activities, along with known Russian agent contacts led him to believe crimes were being actively committed. He took those concerns to the FBI as a private citizen and not acting on behalf of or on orders from Fusion GPS.

Steele was suspended as a FBI source. The exact reasons are unknown but most seem to think its his leaking to the press. Thats when fusion GPS picked him up and set up a back channel to the FBI so they can continue using this discredited information as evidence for a FISA application. They set up this back channel to they can mask the source of the information that they are giving to the courts, because if known they would not be able to obtain the warrant. They then had steele leak the contents of his dossier to YAHOO news had them run a story then used that very same story to corroborate and lend credibility to the dossier. 



Easy provable case of fabricating evidence in a attempt to weaponize the IC to do your opposition research for you so you have a better chance at removing the president. Thankfully your rats have no power anymore and noone is protecting them except for the a couple stragglers that will be outed soon enough. Get fucked.

Carter Page was under investigation for being a Russian Agent since 2013.  Long before Trump even thought of being president

The quote in the memo about Steele not wanting Trump to be president lacks context.  The context is provided in the Glenn Simpson testimony.  During Steele's investigation he found evidence that Trump businesses and Jared Kushner businesses showed signs that money laundering was occurring.  These activities, along with known Russian agent contacts led him to believe crimes were being actively committed.  He took those concerns to the FBI as a private citizen and not acting on behalf of or on orders from Fusion GPS.  When Steele saw these crimes, his opinion was that we should not have a criminal elected president under any circumstances.  No brainer there.

Trey Gowdy says this does not stop the investigation and he has full faith in McCabe, Mueller and Rosenstein

Trump spokespeople claim Carter Page was not on Team Trump and Trump himself denies even knowing the guy.  So either he had nothing to do with Trump and therefore has no bearing on TrumpRussia, or he was actually a foreign policy advisor for Trump.  In which case your Dear Leader is lying.

Would they have been able to obtain any number of indictments if it wasnt for the FISA warrants? Are any of these indictments in relation to the collusion charge?

The only thing you have to show that this investigation is going anywhere are these indictments. The only way you got any of these indictments was fabricating evidence so you can have full surveillance on them and catch them in a simple lie. If the charges on Flynn were directly tied to collusion with Russia and can be proven then the case should continue but thats not what happened. In fact they immediately recused the judge that approved the warrants and accepted Flynn's plea. And now they are delaying that even more in the light of the memo. 


I just dont understand how you can use these examples that you are on to something when its PROVEN that they had to fabricate evidence to obtain the information used to indict them. Just a few years ago dems and liberals would hate these secret courts and now here we are with you people feverishly defending them being so blatantly abused.

Those text messages are not """"politically charged"""" - they're day to day ops between colleagues who happen to be having an affair.  Writing the memos, who do we talk to, can I go in his office now that his secretary has gone etc.

This does not create a fruit-of-the-poison-tree evidentiary problem - the dubious fact that investigators had bias in their investigation - which these texts don't actually show - wouldn't change the underlying facts unless they either:

1) Created evidence - there is no such allegation; 

2) Withheld evidence - there is no such allegation; or

3) Had chain of custody issues with the evidence collected in their investigation - there is no such allegation.

As such, the fact that think that Trump is a terrible person (a position which more than half of the country agrees with and is actually NOT in evidence here) may taint the political process and the congressional investigations, but does so no more than Devin Nunes' dishonest """"memo"""" or Gowdy's backflips.  The political process is entirely beside the point.  Meanwhile, as soon as this information surfaced, Mueller fired them like the straight shooter he is.  From an attorney's standpoint, not only does that undercut the """"vast left-wing conspiracy"""" but it also demonstrates once again that Mueller's behavior is beyond reproach.

The facts remain the facts and the evidence remains the evidence.  It may make you sad and frustrated, but that doesn't change the evidentiary standard and the behavior of the investigators really doesn't impact anything unless any of the three above listed items are proven true.  Even then, it would only taint those pieces of evidence which were touched by (or manufactured by) the two of them.  
The """"loaded for bear"""" comment is a deeply political one - don't want to piss off the potential new boss.  There aren't similar texts about investigating Trump because of the McConnel-Price-Giuliani-NYPD conspiracy which suppressed that end of the investigation.

Using opposition research to push a investigation on the person you are running against is manipulation. Was there A FISA warrant before the dossier hit the desk? Nope. They created the evidence needed used the obvious connection in the IC and got what they needed. 

&gt;The Special Counsel investigation was manipulated

Was Strzok on it? Was the Dossier needed to initiate the counsel? 

&gt;That Strzok and Page have bias against Trump
&gt;That Strzok's and Page's bias against Trump affected their job performance in any way.

In previously released text messages they have Strzok """"disappointed"""" he couldn't find collusion yet. Why would a unbiased person be disappointed the President ISNT colluding with a foreign nation? Would this disappointment motivate fabrication? 


&gt;That Strzok's and Page's job performance affected the investigations of Clinton or Trump in any way.

They literally hand pick agents that would give Hillary the """"best outcome"""" out of the notion she will be president and want to please her. It says it right fucking there in the texts. 


So you have FBI hand picking agents to get HIllary off. Agents taking opposition research to get warrants on the party they are working for opposition. You have them stocking the investigation that is based off of this oppo funded research with the very same people working for Clinton.

It's fair to say the Page and Strzok didn't like Trump.

Neither of those points have been proven. 

This is what I'm talking about when I say you have to show *causality*. It's not enough to place two facts next to each other and assume a connection. You have to demonstrate the connection.

You have a fundamental problem understanding the implications of someone who is working such a important case fucking and discussing the case with someone from different departments. That not only shows a bias but a inability to act proper when faced with such a important task. It shows the ability to lie, distort, and extreme bitterness stemming from being so wrong. You put a anti-trumper who is cheating on his wife with a FBI agent while discussing highly confidential information at a rate of SIXTY THOUSAND text messages on a impartial special counsel.

OK. 

&gt; sure they discussed a insurance plan if trump won

That's not what happened. I will not cede this point. This is not what happened. Their """"insurance plan"""" was to *not to put the Trump investigation on the back burner* despite them thinking he was going to lose. There is zero evidence they were trying to affect the outcome of the election. 

&gt; sure part of the counsel is fucking a senior FBI official and discuss highly charged political matters, 

So? Again, you have to show further evidence that his """"highly charged"""" opinions affected his performance, the investigation, or the outcome in some way. You have NOT shown that. You are ASSUMING. 

&gt;but that doesnt mean they are not impartial!

Sending text messages does not mean an agent is altering or affecting the investigation. Having opinions does not mean an agent is altering or affecting the investigation. Once again, you're making assumptions which aren't supported by evidence.

And for your other comment, yes those misdealings within his staff could easily be the basis for a warrant. On the offending persons not Trump. If page is suspected of something investigate that.

And then subsequently took that surveillance and had somebody un-redact all the names (thats a big deal in FISA) put all the info on spread sheets and pass it around like they were putting out flyers a house party. 

If the investigation was done properly I really would have no issue. If they got the warrant recorded everything and the information stayed within the proper circle and the names remained redacted until they found probable cause I would have no problem. My problem is that I believe they created this """"probable"""" cause to get full surveillance on Trump himself and his team and used the same manufactured evidence as basis to remove the safeguards from the FISA program (redacted names).

It shows us Steele was not acting out of benevolence and has been ferociously trying to take down trump and has monumental bias. This one is hearsay so its not really much. 

McCabe stated bluntly before the committee no surveillance could of been sought without the dossier. 

Senior law enforcement official testified during a closed classfied session to the HIC, that without the Steele dossier, they would not have been able to obtain at least one surveillance warrant for a member of the Trump campaign

FBI &amp; DOJ relied in part, on media reporting to lend credibility to the dossier when they made applications to the FISA courts for these warrants

Fusion GPS &amp; Steele were part of an active campaign to brief major American media outlets (question begs: did the FBI &amp; DOJ subsequently use these same outlets' reporting to obtain the FISA warrants?)

Bill Priestap already flipped, confirmed the dossier was unverified at the time of FISA application.

TL;DR - The explosive part of the memo is that Comey, Yates, McCabe, and Rosenstein 100% knew that the dossier was funded by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign, yet failed to disclose that piece of information to the FISA courts so that all relevant information could be weighed. It is particularly noteworthy that this happened on 4 occasions as the FISA warrant was re-extended 3 additional times (which includes even when Trump was not just President elect, but US President) and each time they failed to disclose to the court the sourcing of the intelligence, which likely would have played a role in their decision to authorize surveillance of Carter Page, and ultimately, the Trump campaign.

Also, one of the major problems pointed out here that is insanely damning, that I think a lot of people may be glossing over, is how they presented evidence to the FISA courts for re-authorization. FBI/DOJ actually used a Yahoo News article as evidence of a 2nd source corroborating the dossier. Here is the problem... Apparently Fusion GPS is the one that fed that story to Yahoo News. So in essence, it was Christopher Steele corroborating his own work. Here's the second problem, apparently they knew that Fusion GPS fed that story to Yahoo news, yet still used it was an evidence for re-authorization of the FISA warrant, as they continued to package and present the intelligence as their own, not coming from a partisan oppo research firm.

Another thing of particular note as well is that it does seem a bit more obvious as to the why, going back a few months ago, the FBI, the DoJ, and even many in the Democrat party were fighting to stop the information coming out on who funded the dossier. Well, turns out the FISA court not being told this piece of information is a bad thing.

If you think about it, if the sole source of the intelligence is from a lone biased party, you tend to want to weight the information a little better, possibly vet it and verify it yourself. The problem here is the memo shows the FBI was not able to do that, but they still packaged up the """"intel"""" as their own, removed that it came from oppo research of a political party, and presented it to get FISA warrants. I'll probably get downvoted for pointing out the inconvenient truth that this is insanely damning and looks very bad.

I will say that this memo was way the hell hyped up to be the be all end all of government corruption, and I am sure that many people here will dismiss it, but one thing that I will admit also looks pretty bad is the fact the the memo mentions that Steele had a falling out with the FBI for lying to them, so they discontinued talking to him as he was leaking information to the press, under the direction of Fusion GPS, whilst the FBI was trying to keep the dossier quiet so they could vet it and verify the intelligence themselves. So, Steele leaked info to the press on the dossier, which upset the FBI, and then Steele lied about it. So, Steele lost favor with the FBI.

Here is the catch... Fusion GPS still continued to funnel information to the FBI through a new liaison, Bruce Ohr of the DoJ. Ohr's wife was a senior executive for Fusion GPS, so whilst the FBI was no longer taking Christopher Steele's calls, Ohr was taking all of the information from Fusion GPS and giving it to the FBI himself, thus continuing to have the dossier essentially used as evidence further. The problem is that it seems the FBI didn't do much to verify any of that information at all, just accepted it as fact, bundled it up nicely as their own intelligence report, even though it came from oppo research of a political campaign, and misled the court of its origin. It definitely looks bad even though people will try to downplay it here, most likely. It particularly looks bad because apparently these senior FBI and DOJ officials knew where the intelligence was coming from, but decided to package it to the FISA court as if it was intelligence from themselves. This could be argued as an intent to deceive the FISA courts. At the very least, it's extremely likely there is going to be some major lawsuits that come out of this.

The memo does very little to address anything to do with Stokh and Page, if anyone was wondering, though it does mention them meeting with Andrew McCabe to talk about an """"insurance policy"""" against Trump, which again, definitely sounds bad.

Final brief thoughts on why this is bad for McCabe and especially for Comey:

Remember when Comey testified before Congress that the dossier was, and I quote exactly, """"... salacious and unverified,"""" telling Congress his thoughts on the whole dossier as not being reliable and some things completely false? Well, according to this memo, Comey's own signature signs off on the FISA application, using this dossier as evidence, to obtain surveillance warrant. He can't have it both ways. He can't tell Congress it's tabloid quality stuff, salacious, unverified and so on, but then sign off on it being used to obtain a FISA warrant? That seems pretty bad.


Spin that bro..





This reveals that the investigation into links between Russia and the Trump campaign violated some of the most cherished principles of our democracy, namely:

&gt;That a court may not consider an individual piece of evidence in deciding an issue unless that piece of evidence, standing alone, proves the issue to the point of absolute epistemological certainty.

&gt;That an investigation may only be conducted by individuals that view the investigation's target favorably and agree with that target politically.

&gt;That a court must reject evidence provided in support of a warrant where the source of the evidence does not support the election to the presidency of the investigation's target.

Here's the primer I wrote collected entirely from publicly available firsthand sources. 


***


## What we know for certain - Evidence of felonies and abuse of power with only primary sources

###The Crime
What is claimed is that members of the Trump campaign **conspired to accept a thing of value from a foreign national**. Another claim is that **Currently, Jared Kushner is is violation of federal law and committed a felony in his assumption of position**. And finally **Donald Trump is abusing his power as president to obstruct justice in the investigation of these matters**. 

- With conspiracy laws (the legal term for collusion), the crime itself is the agreement to commit a crime - [1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/conspiracy) [2](https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?typed=Conspiracy&amp;type=1) [3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_(criminal)). This would normally be hard because it requires knowing intention to some degree. We have that. 

- Jared Kushner tweeted his own campaign emails. These emails were corroborated by Don Trump Jr. in a separate tweet. Both man have stated publicly that these tweets were real and from them. 

- In these tweeted images, Kusher states his intention and frame of mind plainly in the first image as, """"[The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was political opposition research... I decided to take the meeting](https://twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr/status/884789418455953413)"""" We now know that Kushner and Don Jr. believed the meeting to be about a thing of value, political opposition research. And made an attempt to meet. 

- If his testimony included the statement that this meeting was to rebuke the offer, it wouldn't be collusion. His testimony is that they had the meeting and the Intel was instead a [conversation about child adoption and the Magnitsky act](https://twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr/status/884789418455953413?lang=en).  If the info wasn't delivered, the legal term is *ineffectual collusion*. It is a crime.

- The child adoption and [Magnitsky Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/6156) are about sanctions on Putin and his response for which [Putin has attempted to blackmail and bribe politicians into dropping in the past](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3901780/07-26-17-Bill-Browder-Testimony.pdf)

- Federal election law says [a foreign national cannot contribute a thing of value to a campaign](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/11/110.20). The thing of value is the opposition research. It's well established that this is something that people might pay for and the email makes it clear that the Trump campaign, """"[like it very much](https://twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr/status/884789418455953413?lang=en)"""". [Trump himself even publicly asked for the Russians to steal it](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N1MbFesSC7M). Which we've established it is illegal. 

- Despite producing evidence himself that Kushner lied on his own [top secret clearance disclosure forms](https://www.state.gov/m/ds/clearances/60321.htm) - a felony. And yet Kushner still has that clearance and his job because his father in law is Trump. This is an ongoing abuse of power. It is happening right now.

Its the same exact tactic the pepe pizza crowd boys take when trying to misconstrue truths and take it to the conclusion they WANT. 

And this is the exact reason why burden of proof is solely on the accuser. The only things corroborated are the points of origin in the story. The parts that haven't are ANY of the crimes or salacious accusations against Trump. 

But yeah sure Ill address the rest of you r comment. 


&gt;Why do you think the FISA court had no corroborating evidence? 

The fact they had to corroborate the dossier with a yahoo news story. If they had ANYTHING else other then that it would of been used first. 

&gt;The one Democrats have written a response to that tells more of the story that the President won't allow to be released (I wonder why???).

I dont know why you are wondering, they have to get rid of sensitive information then it will be released. 


&gt;I love that you think information that is not public means it doesn't exist. All these Trump cultists asking for proof in the middle of an ongoing investigation that involves some of the most sensitive information our country has.

Again, if there is a treasurer trove of corroborating evidence the yahoo news story corroborating it would of been not needed in the least. That one action speaks volumes to a skeptic. 


&gt;The beer is still being brewed, and the GOP is upset they haven't been fed the raw hops and barley yet (as they keep trying to stall and mess with the final product), and is now claiming there is no beer. It's right there in the hopper, dummies! It's just not done yet, nor safe to drink! If you dipshits would stop interfering and trying to obstruct the brewing process it would be done sooner.

We didnt make page &amp; strozk have a affair discussing highly sensitive information. We didnt put someone on the team who held such obvious bias. We didnt make him discuss back up plans and secret societies. So for brewers story there it would be more accurate if they stopped the brew process somewhere in the begging busted a nut in it, and are mad no one wants to drink it still. Fuck off and do it proper if you want a good beer.

IT WAS INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING AND INCOMPLETE WHICH IS WHY EVERYONE OUTSIDE THE CULT OF TRUMP URGED IT TO BE WITHHELD. 

I cannot for the life of me wrap my head around the official GOP story, which involves so many brain contortions and circular logic it makes your head hurt, when the truth is so much simpler: Trump and the Russians are great buds dating back from when the Russians bailed him out of the real estate collapse. While he was radioactive to US banks and none of them would lend him a dime, he got dough from the Russians. His idiot sons have admitted this in numerous appearances and interviews before the election. Remember when Don Jr. said """"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia""""? In exchange, he let them launder all sorts of dirty money through his foreign developments (check out the Trump Panama Tower and the shady cast of characters who bought units there, which is now a ghost-town. Then check out Trump Azerbaijan. Then check out the Russian dude who paid $100 million for a Trump Florida estate appraised at $40 million, then tore it down and never did anything with the land. People don't just do that for fun). They're all fronts for money laundering, which incidentally is part of the Manafort indictment).  

So then Trump decides he's going for it - running for Prez. He has all sorts of Russian buds who tell him they can help him - they have a sophisticated cyber operation and are pretty fucking expert at creating propaganda. Of course Trump says sure, because he's a narcissistic asshole and doesn't care about petty little things like """"laws"""". In exchange for their help, Putin wants sanctions lifted or unenforced. You know, """"adoptions"""" (ie the Magnitsky act, which has Russian assets frozen all over the world and has been a real thorn in the side of Putin &amp; his buddies). 

This whole thing is about money laundering in exchange for sanctions relief. Putin doesn't give a cold tin fuck about Trump - probably thinks he's a complete fucking idiot like the rest of the world. But he's a useful idiot, and if America can rip itself apart from within over the election of this ignoramus buffoon, even better for Russia. 

Why is that so hard to grasp? All of this bullshit about Strzok and Page and Hillary is dust being kicked up by a group of criminals who know they're fucked, and their last ditch move is to discredit the career professionals who are investigating them.

The only things they should have any kind of say in stopping dangerous content is putting online any child pornography, murder, rape, or radical terrorism not political or religious views (and I am not a religious person nor do I practice any religion whatsoever but will fight for your right to not silence you.... because our Constitution gives you the inalienable right to not be persecuted based on your religion! And not letting you speak you mind violates our freedom of religion and is persecution. We have got to stop Google and our govt from chipping away at our 1st, 2nd, and 4th Amendment rights. Why do we think we left England...for religious freedom and to be taxed only if we are represented which is a whole other convo. The writers of our sacred Constitution were brilliant as they knew how corrupt men were and knew this day might come when they pushed to change things IN the Constitution. There was only one time where they opened up the Constitition to change it and that was when they added the Bill of Rights. So that us how we got the 12 Amendments...not to change the original Constitution. We, each, American needs to read the Constitution and really understand how it affects your daily life. It is an amazing document and I am incredibly thankful for living in a country that guarantees things so basic and so important for all free people. As an American woman although I can moan and groan about not making as much as my fellow American man all the really important stuff makes that seem shallow and pales in comparison to all the wonderful things I have because of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

The only things that should """"change"""" in the Constitution are things that can be ADDED that are good for all people not take away what is there or change verbiage to satisfy a religious or political viewpoint.

The Convention of States will finally stop ANYONE from making changes to the original document or changing the Amendments based on how the political winds are blowing. How would we like it if they changed our right to free speech and make that freedom only for those who believed in speech that didn't offend the guy deciding on the change. Like I said, when you have corrupt people in charge there must be a way to stop them from ever being able to make changes to what we have already. There should be a vehicle to add to our rights or to take away more govt controls and that is it! No other reason to mess with it. Our govt is using our children to force us to let them change the 2nd Ammendment. Believe it that the school shootings are planned and carried out by our gov't making sure the sick people they use are well armed.

1152,"Lets start with matter of fact statements that are pretty universally accepted as not being misleading. 


&gt;the dossier started as oppo research from a conservative website.

&gt;After Trump emerged as the probable Republican nominee, attorney Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm retained American research firm Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research about Trump on behalf of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton presidential campaign.

&gt;Fusion GPS later contracted Steele to compile the dossier. Following Trump's election as president, funding from the Democrats ceased, but Steele continued working on the report, with financing coming directly from Glenn R. Simpson of Fusion GPS. The completed dossier and its information was then passed on to British and American intelligence services

These are not really up for debate, its all verifiable fact. Now lets move onto the """"allegations"""" contained in the Nunes memo.

&gt;The memo’s more compelling charge is that the FBI did present corroborating evidence for the Steele dossier’s claims — but that said evidence consisted primarily of a Yahoo News article that was based on information leaked by Christopher Steele. If this is true — and if the Steele dossier and Yahoo News article really did constitute the entirety of the FBI’s case — then it appears that the Bureau misled the FISA court, and an American citizen was unfairly subjected to state surveillance.



You have to understand, when this all started Steele was a prestigious British spy and Kremlin expert working on his own accord because of the troubling information he found. As more and more comes out its revealed to us that this man is not only a outspoken never trumper but directly paid by Hillary and her team. Can you see where we might find that a little bit troubling? Not only is it paid opposition research there was a coordinated effort to hide that fact from the public. 

So the very same people who are blaming the loss of their billion dollar cant lose campaign on Russia are the ones paying and directing what steele writes. There is 10 figure motive for them not to do research but to find the conclusion they want. Same with their servers, they refused the FBI access and then paid a private company.

But what really gets me is the act of corroborating it with the yahoo news story. Because if that is truthful it shows almost unequivocally its all bullshit, or they would be able to give actual evidence instead of this circular reporting being used as evidence. 

Its far from a conspiracy theory and you should at-least understand how the other side sees it from their perspective. 

I think what we can agree on at this point is that we both need MORE information and really shouldn't be mad at each-other. The powers at be are trying their hardest to manipulate one way or another and we should just come together and demand real answers.

Hillary's body count, hillary selling uranium to russia, pizzagate, nunes' """"unmasking"""" scandal, the seth rich thing, the 400lb hacker laying on his bed, etc. 

There is one narrative that has enough evidence behind it to garner a serious, sustained investigation by the FBI/Special Council - that's the Russia investigation. It's so credible that the only way Trump supporters like yourself can remain in disbelief is by creating another fake narrative that suggests that somehow the FBI, Hillary, the DNC, huge parts of the """"deep state"""" and others are all working together to fabricate a year-and-a-half long investigation to hamstring Trump. It's literally a conspiracy theory. 

The only way to maintain your narrative in the face of the known facts is to weave this conspiracy theory. Why is the FBI still investigating the Trump thing if Trump says it's BS? Oh, because it's the FBI that's wrong, not Trump.

&gt;Throughout the United States Virgin Islands, high winds, gusting up to 69 mph (111 km/h),[97] and heavy rains, peaking at 3.02 in (77 mm) on St. Thomas,[98] caused significant damage to roadways and power lines. Many residents across the islands were left without power for up to a week as a result of the storm. Following an assessment of the damage, total losses were placed at $2.5 million, allowing the governor of the U.S. V.I. to request for a major disaster declaration from the United States government. This request was later approved by President Barack Obama in late September.[99] In addition to damage to infrastructure, severe losses were sustained in the business sector. As a result of Earl's passage through the region, nearly 22,000 vacationers canceled their plans, resulting in a $10.7 million loss in revenue.[100] In March 2011, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) granted $555,219 in public assistance funding to cover the costs from Earl in the Virgin Islands.

So Obama sat on responding until they lost millions in lost tourist revenue. I mean fucking nothing. Where was the outrage then? Where was the non stop criticism?

&gt; Q. And why did you engage Mr. Steele in May or June of 2016?
&gt; 
&gt; A. That calls for a somewhat long answer. We had done an enormous amount of work on Donald Trump generally at this point in the project and we began to drill down on specific areas. He was not the only subcontractor that we engaged. Other parts of the world required other people. For example, we were interested in the fact that the Trump family was selling merchandise under the Trump brand in the United States that was made in sweat shops in Asia and South America -- or Latin America. So we needed someone else for that. So there were other things. We were not totally focused on Russia at that time, but we were at a point where we were -- you know, we'd done a lot of reading and research and we were drilling down on specific areas. Scotland was another one.

If Fusion hired Steele to manufacture evidence, then where is the Scotland dossier? Where is the sweat shop dossier? And why didn't they release the dossier before the election?",,ghqwertt,2,t1_dtkuwm2,dtkvggc,t3_7ujdl4,t5_3jjnn,1517504733

Honestly I can see your line of attack after it is revealed they used opposition research to obtain FISA warrants.

Just remember how many times you people called me a shill for insinuating they used the dossier to get the warrants.

Pivoting here to """"sure we used it but we had other stuff noone can see and that makes it OK"""" will not be acceptable and there will be punishment for people exploiting a program used to protect Americans to abuse them.

The Clinton trace comment.  I'll grant that this comment does indeed sound odd, except that if you actually look at the surrounding texts, it's clear that we don't have enough information to understand what it means.  It's a far cry from the smoking-gunness of """"Russia has just thrown the election for Trump"""" [1] or """"This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump"""" [2].

Remember too that these lovebirds were hiding an affair, so comments about being traced could make sense.

Being annoyed by BLM protesters: many Americans, liberal and conservative alike, and in particular law enforcement, were annoyed by BLM. Wasn't Trump himself popular among law enforcement precisely because he supported """"blue lives matter""""?

Being annoyed by Bernie supporters: again, this suggests nuanced political views. Everyone would be upset with people who are yelling over the person they wanted to hear talk.

Finally, about them wanting Clinton to win?  If you were an FBI agent and knew of evidence that a political candidate was colluding with a foreign power to swing the election, wouldn't *you* support their biggest competitor?

How about the texts you don't mention, like this one:

#### BEGIN TEXT MESSAGE

  She [Hillary] was ok. B+

  Chelsea was awful. Tried to do Bills up close
  sharing. Didn't come across as genuine. Pius, she has a HORRIBLE
  billv goat speeeh tic

#### END TEXT MESSAGE

I thought the conspiracy was that Strzok was part of some left-wing liberal deep state?  These texts suggest they were actually fairly centrist and willing to criticize Clinton. The details all suggest that Strzok and his love interest had nuanced political views, not that they were part of some left-wing conspiracy.

I'd suggest sticking to a consistent story, except that that would be inconvenient to your conspiracy and your goal of convincing Bernie supporters that the FBI investigation has been compromised.

The facts point to either a conspiracy theory with an inconsistent story or a non-conspiracy with a consistent story.  Your choice. But you'll have more credibility if you lay out, fully documented, a falsifiable theory here.

Your characterizing a worldwide movement by few chuckle fucks that smashed a Starbucks window. It is inherently a decentralized, leaderless movement. The only requirement is you do something about Nazis.

Some monitor their activities online or offline by infiltration (an antifa activist for pepper sprayed in Charlottesville while undercover there). Outing Nazis to employers is another popular tactic. And of course showing up at Nazi rallies to drown out their hateful message and provide a counterpoint. Finally yes some people show up to get into fights with Nazis. If you feel bad about a Nazi getting punched I don’t know what to say. They support literal genocide, that is not something we should ever consider as a valid political point.

There are even people in Syria (i think mostly French) fighting under the antifa flag to free the Syrian people from Islamic fascism and in solidarity with the people of Rojava.

Antifa isn’t just college kids in black block “causing problems”. Go watch coverage of the Charlottesville protests. Tons of people came out and said that if antifa was there (in particular on Friday night on campus ) protecting them.

 Redneck revolt shows up to provide an armed counter point (and first aid) to all the right wing militias which show up to “protect the Nazis free speech”.

Your black and white view of antifa based on a few salacious news reports of anarchists breaking shit is not one which reflects the reality of the situation on the ground. The news reports on what is attention grabbing. And often anarchists show up st the same rallies that antifa does and they go to break shit (sometimes) but are not connected to the antifa organizers.

That sounds great!

&gt;I share text messages with colleagues all the time about how we hate our boss and wish he'd be replaced. It doesn't mean I'm actively sabotaging our teams productivity to make him look bad. I still do my job to the best of my ability knowing he gets the credit for it.

I get that they are human and have their own opinions as everyone does but these are very high level professionals heading a intelligence agency. They are required to maintain a very neutral political stance in regards to investigations. 

&gt;In the same way, these two could want a particular outcome (at that time you'd of course assume their preferred outcome was Hillary losing) but it doesn't prove they aren't going to perform their duties as objectively as the next guy.

Same as above, but it does appear they are not preforming their duties as they would normally. None of this seems remotely ethical or normal behavior for a supposedly neutral and independent FBI.

&gt;As far as the reference to """"Obama wanting everything..."""" This is impossible to fully understand outside of the context of the entire conversation, which we don't have. They COULD just have been overly presumptuous that one of their superiors requests for information was on behalf of the White House.

This is true, but Obama has stated on air that he has no knowledge of the Hillary investigation and has repeatedly insisted the investigation was free of politics and fair. So hopefully through more investigation we can get a better idea of exactly what they are talking about here but giving the rest of the text messages i know what way I would be leaning.  


&gt;And all that aside, even if they were extremely biased - and I'm not saying they weren't - if a crime was committed by Trump or his team, a crime was committed.

Honestly who do you think the troll is in this situation? The guy trying to have normal conversations about different topics or the guy following some person around harassing because they incorrect perceived them as a shill?


Im going to try to phrase this in a way that I wont have the mods jumping down my throat. But you are the problem, its blatantly obvious by your posts that you really dont know much. You are confused by whats going on by just KNOW your right and just KNOW that you are suppose to attack the other """"team"""". 

You are exactly what the Russians are trying to create with their bullshit propaganda. You are the end game. A population unable to have normal conversation because they have been radicalized to the point of seeing the enemy behind anyone who doesnt fall in line.

Its even been highlighted by the Mueller investigation themselves. They effectively preyed on the reactionary behavior and the deeply rooted spite in you people to be able to manipulate you. They effectively preyed on the lazy MSM to be able to amplify their message and even had lefty celebrities show up to their rallies. 

So how about we do exactly what they dont want and work together to sort through the huge amounts of bullshit getting fed from every direction and maybe just maybe we can cut through the smoke and mirrors and get a true glimpse of the reality of whats going on.

This went on for a couple of days until my boss gave the green light for overtime to continue to chase down the bug until found.

Turns out that there was a missing formatter in the """"SELECT .."""" the DB guys had plugged in for us on a date field.

By some stroke of luck, the default date format could be parsed correctly in the morning, but in the afternoon that date string became a """"... PM"""" which caused a weird date to be parsed, and then everything blew up further along because of the wrong date.

Really?  Leased cars are brand new, and if you're smart they are serviced and guaranteed for no extra cost.  Second hand cars will need brake pads, tyres, fluids, filters and regular inspections for signs of wear on more permanent parts.  All of that costs time and effort as well as money which, if you're unlucky, can quickly add up to be in the same ballpark as a lease anyway.

Yeah, it's *possible* a brand new car will break down and it's *possible* you'll get lucky on a second hand car with one lady owner.  But saying it's """"just as likely"""" that a freshly PDI'd model will break down, as that a £1500 shitheap from somebody's front driveway will, is a bit of a stretch.

Before buying, check insurance prices because London is very expensive for car insurance, even out in zone 5.

That way, when you don't need the car anymore you can sell and recoup most of your money. Generally, the less you pay for the car, the less it will depreciate.

Would you take on somebody if you seriously thought this was going to happen?  Would any small enterprise ever hire anyone?  Equality is a nice idea but it will stifle small and slow growing businesses to the point where the only way to get started will be to take a big loan.  And that is not in the interests of the economy at large.

There should be a second class of job, which you as a company have to fulfill certain requirements to offer.  Low turnover (not profit) for example, maybe under 5 employees too.  Basically, a company with little reserve with which to deal with an uncertain absence of a large percentage of its workforce.  This second class job should carry with it either a waiver on the sexism discrimination policy (although this is completely insane and unfair to women who aren't interested in babies), a waiver on the ability to dismiss people for falling pregnant (which we kind of have in the UK given that in theory there's no unfair dismissal if it's in the first two years, although woe betide anyone who tries this out and immediately hires a man) or - and here's a wacky fucking idea - *some kind of increased government support in the case of pregnancy*.

Finally, a good 6-8 months after the birth she notifies the company she won't be working anymore. Meanwhile, she's been getting insurance benefits the entire time and HR is too afraid of a lawsuit to cut her loose. 

Her position has either been unfilled the entire time (requiring her coworkers to cover her share of the work at expense of their own lives), or if the manager is more prescient than most, has already been backfilled, but is still in a blocking pattern preventing other hires but at least not making coworkers' lives miserable.

Yes, the user must install the .NET framework if it is not already on his computer. No, in most cases this isn't a big problem. A few months ago, I rewrote one of my applications in C# and don't regret it for a second. Most users already have the .NET framework and for the other people the installation program will install it. The reason I didn't write it in C# to start with was because I thought that there would be problems when users had to install .NET. There wasn't - no user have reported a problem so far.

Unless you're targeting a platform where .NET isn't installable, I don't think you should let the """"stand-alone"""" requirement get in the way of language choice.

- IF you built a device that could prevent a plane from moving forward, regardless of the mechanics, the plane will not fly.
- You cannot build a treadmill that will prevent the plane from moving forward.

SO:
Hypothetically, if you could build such a treadmill (one so fast that the friction of the wheels counters the forward thrust) then the answer to the question is """"No, the plane will not fly"""".

HOWEVER, such a treadmill is probably physically impossible.

If you were using a 100% efficient motor and also using it as a 100% efficient regenerative braking system AND there was no friction or air resistance then your net energy loss from the battery would be zero.  Merely moving from point A to point B does not consume energy; only changing the velocity (i.e. speed or direction) or pulling away from a gravitaional or electromagnetic force costs energy.  Ferdinand is spot on (although I would have said 'altitude' rather than 'height' - deforming the car is a whole other problem).

It's only because our world is full of friction, air resistance and other inefficiencies that this is counterintuitive.  The implications are huge; a long space flight for example only requires, in theory, a big push at the beginning.  You'd then drift in a straight line for as long as you liked without burning any more fuel until something happened to slow you down or change your direction.

The 100 J would be used up during the acceleration portion of the motion, during which some of this energy, let's say 20 J would be converted into the car's kinetic energy, and the remaining 80 J lost as heat. When the car brakes and comes to a stop, its 20 J of kinetic energy are also lost as heat.

Paris: First trains on a Monday are at 0540, 0701, 0731, 0755, 0831. Any departures after these times will get you into Paris after Midday.

I opted for 0701 and got to Paris at 1011 (20 min check in and STP). Getting bought in straight to Gare du Nord is easily the best thing about getting to Paris. No need to faff about at an airport.

Spent a great day in Paris, opting for the last service from Gare du Nord at 2113. Got back at 2230, and back on my PC at home at 2255. Had about 10 hours in Paris. Went up a metal tower to look at rooftops. Had some snails. It was all fun.

Pretty much the same for Brussels. I have done 2 day trips (after the 1st one, I was told I can use any connecting train, so did a day trip to Bruges. Got the first train at 0650 and arrived at 0959.

Return was 1952 back at 2103 and was running late the 2nd visit, got back at 22.30, about 90mins late.

(Seriously, setting up email can be a pain. I've created an email server software myself and it's almost hard to believe the number of ways end-users can screw up their config.)

For users who have not installed .NET prior to running the installation program, my installation program tells the user that """"I need .NET, OK?"""". The user clicks OK, and then the installation program downloads and installs .NET without any user intervention. This is the part I consider to be easier than specifying correct host names and port settings in email configuration...The user just have to click """"OK"""". You could skip that as well, but """"expert"""" users may get upset if you install .NET without telling them.

Many (most?) program you can use to create installation programs already has such functionality built-in. Here's a tutorial/library which I used successfully (it's specific to InnoSetup).
http://www.codeproject.com/KB/install/dotnetfx_innosetup_instal.aspx

If the software is shipped on a CD-ROM, the .NET installation can be put in a folder next to the installation software so that the user doesn't have to wait for the download during installation.

Zenbook? lol. I like the Zenfone 2 (its better than the iPhone 4 that I had before), its only crashed on me **once** (stupid error made by me when updating) which needed a complete factory reset. 

I did install **Cyanogenmod** which bumped me up to the latest and greatest (compared to stock, havent installed 14.1 yet), so that accounts for some of the other random bugs I have experienced. I still wished Asus would put forth a little more Hereford toward keeping this phone updated, but thats something I guess I will live with. 

Overall, I would buy again, **however** toward the end of the year I may look at what Motorola/Lenovo has came out with for the $200-$300 price point since Asus's Zenfone line has became confusing to say the least, and if Lenovo can build phones like there Thinkpads-I would buy it just for that reason.

In his 5th grade class they play a lot of them, one-week units at a time, and he almost always ends up the class champion. But when he's in a high-pressure situation, he sometimes falters, and he really beats himself up about it. 

A few weeks ago, the game his class was playing was Pente, and again he's the class champ, undefeated. And one Thursday night the school had a big parents vs kids Pente tournament. Dozens and dozens of games where various parents play various kids in the class. This happens every year, and the parents haven't lost in over a decade. 

An hour full of frantic games pass, and with one game remaining, the adults and kids are tied, like 102-102 or something. And the remaining game that will decide it all... Whether the kids will emerge victorious for the first time since the Bush era... Is me versus my son. The kids are hyped up like crazy because they are close to a victory, and the guy they're pinning their hopes on is my son, their best player (who has already beaten me once earlier in the competition). They are packed around the table, chanting his name. But I can see... He is stressing out big time and getting super frazzled. And with the game on the line... He blows it. Makes a really bad move that essentially hands me the game, and the parents yet another victory. He realized it and I could see he was just devastated. 

So I just stare hard at the board... Fake concentrating as convincingly as I can... And pretend not to see it. Made a different play, he pounces and wins, the kids all go ape shit and he walks home on cloud nine, reveling in having stopped the parent win streak.

This is what I was thinking of:

&gt; Under the pricing practices guide, administered by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, **the length of the new lower price sale should not be longer than the old higher price was available for.**

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23797882

Here are the full guidelines:

&gt; 1.2.3 As noted in para. 1.1.2, the basis of a price comparison should be reasonable
in terms of time, and what is reasonable will depend on the circumstances. But
where the basis of the comparison is not set out explicitly;

&gt; (a) A price used as a basis for comparison should have been your most recent price
available for 28 consecutive days or more;

&gt; (b) The period of time for which the new (lower) price will be available should not be
so long that the comparison becomes misleading. How long this will be will depend
on all the circumstances. But as a general guideline which could be applied to
cases in which there are no specific circumstances which might mean that a longer
period would not be misleading, **it is suggested that the period of time for which the
new (lower) price will be available should not be more than that for which the old
(higher) price was available**; and

&gt; (c) **Comparisons should not be made with prices last offered more than six months
ago.**

If the Titanic had hit that iceberg head-on, instead of letting it gouge its way down multiple sections, she might well have stayed afloat long enough to be safely evacuated.

According to the link posted by /u/astalavista114 the Britannic might even have survived the mine:

&gt; The ... crucial bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four and its door were undamaged and should have guaranteed the ship's survival. However, there were open portholes along the lower decks... As the ship's list increased, water reached this level and began entering aft from the bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four. With more than six compartments flooded, Britannic could not stay afloat.

So actually the critical weakness of *Britannic* wasn't explosives but over-enthusiastic medical staff.

You can see why they thought the design was worthy of the """"unsinkable"""" moniker; most other boats would just sink as soon as there was a single hole anywhere in the hull allowing more water in than could be pumped out.

Also, I noticed you're doing a `return false` at the end to stop the browser from loading a new page/modifying the hash, but I'm pretty sure (and someone correct me if I'm wrong) that using `event.preventDefault()` is the preferred method for event catching/redirection.

EDIT: One more thing, I noticed in process.js that you have several repeated click events bound to your handlers. Although it's really not a big deal, you could consider an exercise in modularization by trying to turn that particular repeated function into one modular method.

Give them all the same class, say `processItem`, then something like this:

&gt; A 20 year maximum sentence for anyone who unlawfully assaults another who dies as a direct or indirect result of the assault. If the offender was intoxicated by alcohol or drugs, a minimum of eight years and a maximum 25 year sentence applies.

&gt; * **Voluntary intoxication removed as a mitigating factor in sentencing**
&gt; Voluntary intoxication by drugs or alcohol will be removed as a mitigating factor when courts determine sentences

Basically they introduced minimum mandatory sentencing, and removed """"being drunk"""" as being used as excuse. They also introduced controversial [""""Lockout Laws""""](http://www.nsw.gov.au/newlaws) around the same time which has killed much of Sydney's nightlife.

&gt;Rather an amusing thing happened while dressing that morning.  I was very cold when I got back into the boat, and, in my hurry to get my shirt on, I accidentally jerked it into the water.  It made me awfully wild, especially as George burst out laughing.  I could not see anything to laugh at, and I told George so, and he only laughed the more.  I never saw a man laugh so much.

&gt;I quite lost my temper with him at last, and I pointed out to him what a drivelling maniac of an imbecile idiot he was; but he only roared the louder.  And then, just as I was landing the shirt, I noticed that it was not my shirt at all, but George’s, which I had mistaken for mine; whereupon the humour of the thing struck me for the first time, and I began to laugh.  And the more I looked from George’s wet shirt to George, roaring with laughter, the more I was amused, and I laughed so much that I had to let the shirt fall back into the water again.
&gt;
&gt;“Ar’n’t you—you—going to get it out?” said George, between his shrieks.
&gt;
&gt;I could not answer him at all for a while, I was laughing so, but, at last, between my peals I managed to jerk out:
&gt;
&gt;“It isn’t my shirt—it’s yours!”
&gt;
&gt;I never saw a man’s face change from lively to severe so suddenly in all my life before.
&gt;
&gt;“What!” he yelled, springing up.  “You silly cuckoo!  Why can’t you be more careful what you’re doing?  Why the deuce don’t you go and dress on the bank?  You’re not fit to be in a boat, you’re not.  Gimme the hitcher.”

2121,"It is more expensive to produce: takes longer and requires more malt to feed to the yeast.  But more significantly, there's more duty to pay.

&gt; **Beer Duty rates**
&gt; Most beers are charged General Beer Duty at £19.12 per hectolitre % of alcohol. For example, if you release a batch of 5 hectolitres of beer of a strength 4.0% ABV, your Beer Duty liability would be £382.40 (£19.12 × 5 × 4.0).
&gt; 
&gt; **High strength beer**
&gt; High Strength Beer Duty is charged on beer that exceeds 7.5% ABV and this is in addition to the General Beer Duty. This additional charge is set at £5.09. For example, if you release a batch of 5 hectolitres of beer of a strength 8.0% ABV, your Beer Duty liability is £968.40:
&gt; 
&gt; General Beer Duty - £19.12 × 5 × 8 = £764.80
&gt; 
&gt; High Strength Beer Duty - £5.09 × 5 × 8 = £203.60
&gt; 
&gt; **Lower strength beer**
&gt; Lower strength beer which is more than 1.2% ABV but not more than 2.8% ABV is set at £9.17. For example, if you release a batch of 5 hectolitres of beer of a strength 2.8% ABV, your Beer Duty liability will be £128.38:
&gt; 
&gt; Lower Strength Beer Duty - £9.17 × 5 × 2.8 = £128.38

2228,"&gt; Theres no room to agree/disagree.

Evidently.

All I'm saying is this: back in the day, a locked phone was, to someone without the lock code or the technical knowledge to hack it, a brick.  As you said, older Androids and iphones either didn't support voice control at all or didn't support it from the lock screen.  So the behaviour of locked phones has changed radically from being secure bricks to being something that, potentially, could run up your bill, give away your friends' numbers and hand anyone who picks it up a very credible way to impersonate you.  And that's not someone with technical knowledge, that's to anyone with a finger and a voice.

If that makes me a dinosaur, so be it, but it's still pretty shocking to me.",t1_ckwnlu4,pineapplecharm,1,t1_ckwn5cq,ckwnlu4,t3_2hsnuk,t5_2qh16,1412096966,ckwn5cq,"&gt; I'm still not sure what the significance of its newness is. 

I literally just told you twice, and I'm not the only one who has told you this. I'm not sure how this is confusing. A lot of brand new Android phones have voice commands accessible from the lock screen on by default. If your Android phone isn't brand spanking new… as in… manufactured in the last month or so, that it doesn't apply.

&gt;The phone I found was a 4, which suggests it wasn't exactly factory fresh either.

What does that have anything to do with Android?

Also, it couldn't have been a 4, as they don't support Siri.

&gt;I think I fundamentally disagree with you on that last point. 

Theres no room to agree/disagree. Handing data over to advertisers and making phone calls from the lock screen are two very very different things. Period.

&gt;I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that a phone which is locked is not able to make calls.

That's your opinion. In my opinion, phones shouldn't have a lock screen enabled by default… and surprise, no phone does have a lock screen enabled by default!

&gt;I remember hearing that locked iphones could return a missed call when locked, which is actually pretty useful if you find a lost one. But being able to call any number from it? That's not the default expectation of the majority of users.

I don't think you are personally aware of the default expectation of the majority of users.

&gt;Just because you've heard about something doesn't make everyone who hasn't, or who wasn't expecting it, a moron.

Where have I suggested that it did?

My mom can't figure out her Android phone for the life of her… like she can't figure out how to do anything, even after I've explicitly showed her. Before that she had an iPhone and it was the same story. She's not a moron, she just isn't good with technology.

&gt;You and I know it's just a setting but nobody I've spoken to about it has said, """"oh yeah, that's how I like it!"""" - they have all said, """"holy fucking shit, can I turn that off??""""

(1.) Engage the customer. Nobody cares about your product. Take the pen, look it over and then very calmly set it down off to the side of the desk. Make eye contact and in the most genuine tone you can muster, begin asking questions of your """"client"""" and his pen needs. 

(2.) Ask good questions. Ask a lot of them. Make the client feel """"heard"""".

So I hear you're in the market for a pen?
Blue or black?
What kind of quantities do you need? 
What will this pen be used for?
Are you partial to a particular brand?
How important is price to you?

(3.) Make sure you have conceptual agreement, meaning, affirm that the client feels heard and probe just a little bit farther to give him an opportunity to bring up things you haven't covered. Repeat back his needs and then ask a couple insightful probing questions. It will sound like this. 

""""Well, Bob I'm thrilled that you've decided to consider purchasing pens through my company. From what we've talked about, it sound like you need a crate of black pens which will primarily be used for signing contracts so they need to have a high quality feel to them but you said you're really not all that particular about the brand as long as it looks nice and writes well. Price isn't a huge issue for the right pen but you of course want to keep an eye on the bottom line. Is there any other factors that I should be aware of? Is there something I forgot to ask? """"

(4.) Soft close him. A soft close is where you ask for his commitment to the sale without actually signing anything. Sounds like this. 

""""So let me ask you, Bob. If I came back to you with an offer of pens that  does x, y, z (list off his needs again) and meets your budget, is there any reason why you wouldn't want to move forward with this deal?

(5.) Finally go back and pick up the original pen and sell it to him.

""""I have great news bob, we just got in a shipment of high quality black pens that write good and feel great in the hand. The best news is we got them in at a great price so you can actually afford to give a few of them away to your customers as gifts. They're ready to ship right away and I brought you a sample to take a look at."""" *hand him the pen* offer to answer any extra questions he may have about it.

(6.) Close him by asking how he would like to proceed.

HS will free up major lines such as the West Coast for an increasing amount of rail freight. Considering the base level benefits of rail freight vs. road freight, you can see why this is good.

Also consider the width of some train lines vs. that of major roads (motorways etc.). Once you get out of the city centres where all lines come together, railways are much thinner.

This version is for online release, we will make a few changes later on for film festivals. Our aim was to help the campaign and make a better understanding of the situation that is happening in the Undercroft but projecting it in a bigger light. 

These spaces, created by people as their own. Places that would of just have been left alone without no use., but are brought to life with these communities that use them. We wanted to show that these spaces, bring character to the city we live. Over taking these spaces with commercial use is not progress. Financially, it makes sense for the South Bank Centre to have retail units to finance their redevelopment of the festival wing. South Bank's view to increase the access of art is a good investment, but they turn a blind one when they are willing to destroy a creative community that have existed for 40 years... A space that could be argued that it already bring the South Bank stretch financial reward, with the people that come to see what happens at the Undercroft. 

Is it that the South Bank Centre doesn't view the urban activities in the undercroft as part of their cultural counterpart? Is it the reason that over the the Dalson Curve Garden is under threat, due to genrefication of the area or the fact that over the last few years, property prices have been rising, so it make financially sense to build flats...

Every people you interview will have a story to tell, your job is to manage how they tell that story.

If the bike is on private property, and you can remove it without causing damage, then yes, you can remove it and put it into safe storage elsewhere for the owner to reclaim.

If you have to damage the locks to remove it -- that's where it gets really difficult.

Technically, that's civil damage, and if the lock is expensive the owner might have grounds to demand compensation.

If the bike is there for several days though, you can argue that it was """"abandoned"""" and you are entitled to remove it -- but there is no explicit definition of how long the bike has to be there before that kicks in.

The law is frankly, in my opinion a bit of an arse in this regard. If someone dumps something on my property, then I should be free to do with it as I deem fit. But the law disagrees. As do lots of motorists who get terribly upset when their cars are clamped after they dump it on private property without asking for permission.

Also, I posted my experience in a similar thread...

_I use my pebbles with an iPhone on iOS 10 and it works great. I have also used my watches with an Android phone. While the experience is richer on Android, I am perfectly content having my pebble paired with my iPhone._

_As far as the richer experience, you have greater interaction with notifications on Android. For example, if one of your friends Checks-in on Swarm, you can """"Like"""" it directly from the watch. On iOS, that same notification only allows you to dismiss the notification from the watch and phone's lock screen._

_Also, on Android, you have greater control over the font size and can create customized vibrations for different app notifications._

_One thing I miss being able to do after returning to my iPhone was the ability to mute and unmute the ringer on my phone using my watch. With vibrations on my watch, I tend to mute my phone at work, but I often misplace it in my office. Using the watch to make the phone ring is great, but if the phone is muted, it's not very helpful._

* UK Dudley eats in """"hamburger bars"""" but his US version prefers """"Hamburger restaurants""""
* At the zoo, British Dudley's """"knickerbocker glory wasn’t big enough"""" but in the US it """"didn’t have enough ice cream on top"""".  I actually prefer the latter, and wonder if it's just a later edit.
* In the USA Sorting Hat scene Dean Thomas (the soccer fan) is """"tall"""" and """"black"""", neither of which is mentioned in the British. (One wonders why they didn't make him keen on basketball for good measure)

The rest is just the fifteen (yes, just fifteen) instances of """"Philosopher"""" being changed to """"Sorcerer"""".  I'm amazed to learn they actually bothered to film alternate dialogue without bothering to change the same lines in the books!

* The AW's screen is touch-sensitive and activates based on wrist movement, so I do miss just not worrying about that stuff at all on Pebble. I'm very aware of my wrist at all times.

* Needing to turn the watch to get the time isn't a huge deal since the raise to wake is good, but honestly I do miss just shooting sideways glances at my watch to check stuff.

* My AW feels like an expensive gadget that I need to take care of whereas my PTR just felt like a watch. I'm sure this will fade a bit as I get used to my AW though. It's especially ironic since the AW is leagues more durable.

* Pebble is very straightforward and simple and it's easy to memorize it so well you can operate it without looking, while the AW needs you to look at it.

* I'm surprised at how little I miss the watch faces on Pebble, but I do miss many of the apps: Rain was excellent, Snowy had great IFTTT support, Commute is way better than ETA, etc. I never thought I cared *that much* about apps on Pebble but turns out I do miss them.

* Not worrying about battery life. This is another that will fade as I get used to the battery life but right now I find myself checking the battery just to gauge how fast it drains. As an example, I took it off the charger at 8:45am this morning. It's 1:01pm and it's at 84%. That's A-OK and it'll definitely last me the rest of the day but it is on my mind whereas the PTR's battery was not.",,kvothe-arliden,10,t1_d82tdp3,d82uuba,t3_54l9ih,t5_2txls,1474909412

&gt; The 1955 Modernisation Plan promised expenditure of over £1,240 million; steam locomotives would be replaced with diesel and electric locomotives, traffic levels would increase and the system was predicted to be back in profit by 1962.[5] Instead losses mounted, from £68 million in 1960 to £87 million in 1961, and £104 million in 1962.[6][7] The BTC could no longer pay the interest on its loans. The government lost patience and looked for radical solutions.

&gt; By 1961 losses were running at £300,000 a day;[8] since nationalisation in 1948 3,000 miles (4,800 km) of line had been closed,[9] railway staff numbers had fallen 26% from 648,000 to 474,000[note 1] and the number of railway wagons had fallen 29% from 1,200,000 to 848,000.

2644,"Yeah, sources?  'Cause my source is actually seeing baby milk billboards when I was living in a third world country, and knowing personally people who were hired to translate for white-coated fake doctors, roaming the wards to sell formula to new mothers.  Argue all you want about HIV transmission, it's irresponsible to be pushing this stuff onto people in a country so broke it has a 60% unemployment rate.  Starvation or HIV isn't a great choice for your baby; being shit-poor while you scrape together the pennies for formula just heaps misery onto families ill-equipped to deal with it.

But hey, Cheerios are delicious, so whatever.

What beggars belief about Nestlé isn't so much that they were evil bastards in the 1970's - I mean, God knows Europeans don't have a spotless history in Africa, or the third world generally - but that in the Facebook era they continue to get away with it.  I saw maybe one person mentioning any controversy when the new Android OS was called KitKat but when EA charge too much for a computer game the front page loses its shit.  It's baffling.

So yeah, let me know where I'm going wrong because pretty much anything would be less depressing than what I've observed so far.",t1_ccwn9jb,pineapplecharm,35,t1_ccwm66w,ccwn9jb,t3_1ox2xo,t5_2qqjc,1382393970,ccwm66w,"I've been noticing more and more Nestle hate popping up and I would caution people to take the time to really investigate why they are supposed to hate them instead of making snap decisions based off of a few articles and comments. 

Per chance, I happen to have explored the baby formula issue in-depth for school work and was surprised to find myself defending Nestle's positon given all the seemingly manufactured, one-sided, and blind hate towards the company. It was an issue blown out of proportion by a niche campaign that gained traction. Nestle's handled the PR extremely poorly.

There are many details to this opinion that I don't feel like writing out but the bottom-line is that I find the Nestle hate (again in regards to the formula only) was somewhat arbitrary and would make me want to really dig deeper into this bottled water issue instead of just assuming they are wrong.

*It's understandable that I'm taking some heat for not providing sources and the truth is I'm too lazy to dig up past school work I'll make a few points:

* I'm not a corporate shill. In fact, I'm the type of person to pay close attention to my consumption and I work in social policy. My goal in life is to work for a B-Corps because I beleive there is in fact a viable interesection between for-profit business and not just social accountability and reponsibility but as a social benefit.

* I learned this information from an MBA course whose entire intention is to instill corporate responsibility to students via case studies and discussion. In addition to readings, the lesson played out as a mock panel from both sides of the arguement including the state senator charging Nestle, Nestle's PR, an African victim and an African doctor. The information I'm going on comes from an hour and and half discussion.

* I ONLY know the details to the baby-formula issue and some of the most convincing evidence came from health stats (and I understand this is hard to swallow without evidence and that you would be right to not take my word for it), but I think there's a possibility that Nestle's involvement in Africa might have had a net benefit overall-we can not tell for sure because this is hard/impossible to track. It's easy to count how many babies died from lack of/incorrect use of formula. It's not so easy to count all the babies that might have survived from the increased hospital services provided by Nestle. Sure, they only gave money to hopsitals so they are able to push their products, but the ends might justify the means in this case - this is something that can be debated no doubt, but I don't think this is terribly wrong. Also, consider the fact that a malnourished or HIV stricken mothers, of which is not an insignificant population in Africa, would have had no other option anyway.

* There is a misconception that, as someone put it, """"White-coated fake doctors"""" roaming around pushing the formula on people. Not true. They were established medical professionals who were made to hand out the formula as a condition to recieve grant money from Nestle for their hospital, a condition which I am sure they were happy to oblige to. Whether or not you still think that's wrong is up for you to decide, but you must agree it is a far-cry than Nestle hiring actors masquerading as doctors. This is the kind of misinformation being spread around that makes me wary of the ardent protests against Nestle.

* I'm not asserting that there is no blood on Nestle's hand and that all their actions were appropriate, however I do think that there are plenty of injustices in the world being done by many other companies and that this scenario was no worse than others, yet somehow became the most mainstream. Also, I beleive that if no babies died, I'd have learned about this in marketing class as a successful campaign.

* The African community are not the ones who protested, much less boycotted. The issue originates and propogates from the first world who is viewing it from a different perspective than a third world country. Can we really assess what's right and wrong for a culture and life vastly different than ours? 

* This is a very loose analogy, but if what Nestle was doing was so wrong, what about the American fast food industry who thrives on the American underclass. You can say that, with their value menus, they aren't leaving much choice for impovished folks to stuff their faces with food which, after continuous consumption, will eventually lead to poor health. Wouldn't you think it weird if people in France, who has a different perspective that values healthy eating, starts protesting against fast food chains for what they are doing to people in America? Again, loose analogy, more just something to think about.

Although I have come to the conclusion that Nestle's baby formula issue is not as bad as perceived, ultimately my point isnt' necessarily to convince you of that. I just want people to stop and consider the ever-present fact that we may not be getting the full story. If you want to boycott Nestle for their unethcial baby formula marketing practices, then good for you, I would respect your committment. I just hope that it's because you've explored the issue and not because the issue is widely circulated on Facebook and Reddit.

Edit: [found the original](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ipgrk/iama_combat_vet_who_has_lived_the_horrors_of_war/c25n8jj/) - the context, if possible, makes it even better.

&gt;I once ate a tray of 24 assorted muffins: blueberry, lemon poppy-seed, cranberry apple, banana nut, even bran. Large muffins too, like you'd buy at the bakery, not grocery store mini-muffins. I ate the first five or six out of hunger, and the next dozen I can only attribute to gluttony, but the last half dozen were devoured by determination alone. A part of me wanted to stop - I was full, the muffins had become repulsive, and there was a disconcerting pressure in my chest. The other, stronger part of me knew that if I gave up on that muffin platter I would admit limitation.

1) Stop working earlier than you would. I'm talking 11.30. Take the afternoon off
2) Stick some cheesy Christmas tunes on spotify, and get a couple of cheap (£3.50ish) bottles of mulled wine from tesco and one pack of the finest mince pies. You'll have to trust me on this, but I've done it before: you can microwave mulled wine. Do this, stick some clementines in and chat over the year for an hour or so whilst feeling warm and pleasant.
3) Lots of swanky restaurants do really good value lunch menus. You're blokes, I guess you like steak. Go to Hawksmoor or HIX and get the £20 2 course lunch. And share a bottle of £20 wine between the three of you.

So far you've spent just over £90 and you've had a some cheesy music, some mulled wine, a bloody good steak and are feeling a little jolly. It's only 3pm.

There are various other projects written in different languages. Take a look at [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo)

Some people were still rich but the majority of people really weren't so restaurant meals were an impossible luxury.  The market segregated into The Ritz at one end, the corner greasy spoon fry-up house on the other and little in between.

Enter entrepreneurial immigrants from India, many of whom had only arrived recently.  Decent food, served in idiosyncratic but classy surroundings by polite waiters - suddenly the void into which a working class young man's date plans had been mired was filled by a sensible option.  Ditto family outings.  Indian restaurants became a favourite mainly because they swamped a huge market that hadn't really existed before.

Now they're the most reliable option among sit-down restaurants that are reliably open late and have become a firm post-pub favourite.

Ok, I WAS believing you, but now I think you're just fuckin' with us! :)

Assuming you're for real though, I'm going to try to type this response on my phone...with the added distraction of a massive raging bone.

As a gay dude, it makes me so happy to read something like this. Not merely because it's hot, which I obviously would be a fool to try to deny, but because this is a HUGE PART of what we've been fighting for. All the marriage rights, anti bullying stuff, ending dadt, employment non-discrimination; it's not just for us gay dudes, is for you straight guys too. We want you to be free to do stuff like explore your sexuality with your best bud without being terrified of the consequences, without being made to feel ashamed for being curious about how good it feels to fall asleep next to eachother, without fearing what your friends or family might think if they find out, without even having to identify as gay at all for that matter. I fight for gay rights because by liberating one portion of humanity, it is something that I've always hoped would end up freeing all of us. I think I can finally see that slowly happening now and it's fuckin' awesome.

2952,"It's pretty simple, although you should backtrack slightly first.

Instead of using tables, I'd advise you to change the two hour lists to just that - lists.  You could use a UL (unordered list) with each hour as a LI (list item).  Set padding and margins to 0 for both in the CSS and give each LI """"list-style: none;"""" to get rid of the bullets and """"float: left;"""" and sufficient width/height so they can fit the time text inside - the 100x100 you've gone for so far is fine.  The only missing part is to make #hours and #hours_remote float:left too and give them the property """"overflow:hidden"""" so that the floated hour panels don't wrap round onto a new line.  Make sure you give it a decent fixed or """"100%"""" width too.

You'll need is to put two days' worth of hours in #hours_remote as I said, for when you cross the midnight line.

Then comes the smart bit.  You stick #hours_remote into a div called, say, #hours_remote_holder, also floated, width'd and overflow:hidden.  Seems superfluous, right?  Well, when you calculate the time offset you just need to figure out the hour difference and then give #hours_remote a *negative* left-margin so that it moves to the left by the required amount, which will be hours*100 (or however many pixels wide each hour is).  Job done.

2997,"I think the point is that people who tailgate rarely do it because they've forgotten not to tailgate.  They're not skillful drivers, they're already pissed off, they're being aggressive and the only way to get rid of them is either (a) to speed off faster than they can - and I do mean """"can"""" since they will often continue to tailgate you up through 100 just to show off how much you were in their way - or (b) to let them by.  Flashing brake lights, slowing down, waving, giving the finger etc tends simply to enrage them more and cause further risktaking behaviour like undertaking (although if they have room to do this, you're in the wrong) and so on.

Having said all that, I do remember being closely followed by a woman while I was on a driving lesson.  Being inexperienced I felt the pressure to keep my speed up and entered a roundabout faster than I should have.  Leaning over to change down into 3rd I missed and went into 1st.  When I let the clutch up the car almost stopped, and of course with no brake lights.  I was as you can imagine quite flustered by this but managed to limp through the roundabout and out the other side and when I finally remembered to look in the mirror again she was about 100 yards behind me and staying there.  So I guess that technique works.

In other news, I also did the IAM course.. in South Africa.  That shit was so nutty it's not recognised in Europe.  It had mandatory paranoia like counting your wheel nuts before setting off, and always having the doors locked.  My favourite was always leaving a car length ahead when in queueing traffic in case you had to book it out of there to avoid getting carjacked.

Can't remember what the statistic was but apparently majority of accidents and insurance claims in recent years are from being shunted from behind, especially when the driver behind hasn't taken in the speed or stopping distance.  Got told I should put the lights on to remind the driver I was there or at the very least make them question why the hell I was slowing down.

We'd been at the London Book Fair and by the time we got there he was huffing and puffing and complaining like a surly child about how far we'd had to walk.  The moment we stepped inside, his attitude changed.  The bar!  The carved walls! The shit taxidermy!  The manual pre-decimal register!  He thought he'd been transported to fucking *Hogwarts*.  For years afterwards he asked after the place.

Still got a cab back to Earls Court though, the lazy swine.  And he sold """"The Time Traveller's Wife"""" to my main competitor.  Sigh.

Anyway, the Colton was great for years but it was never busy, and with only Queens Club to keep it afloat (and even then he was hard to find round the back) and no food on offer I had no idea how he kept going.

I was an idiot growing up. I am an idiot now but it was more concentrated when I was younger. I have stories like this. I can't believe how selfish and obsintant I was.

I can remember many years ago (at least 2 decades) yelling at my father and telling him I didn't love him. That may seem small when you read it but I will never forget how his posture changed. He went into a slouched position and rested his face on his hands looking infinitely disappointed. There were a number of these situations.

Frankly I am very disappointed with myself for at least the first 20 years of my life.

Now I make sure to at least visit weekly and just talk or just listen. Sometimes on days that aren't holidays I like to do something nice to show them that I appreciate them. We have a closer relationship now then we ever did and that is good. I'll just never forget that I was a self centered outlandish twit a chunk of my life.

3107,"Ah, you got used to it.  But it was a bit like that episode of Scooby-Doo where they're on a train in a tunnel and they run onto a section of treadmill, the train seemingly still moving at speed while they actually stay still in the tunnel.

The most depressing thing about running that section isn't that though.  At a certain point you give up on the idea that neither the horse nor the castle are ever going to look any nearer or further away, and you stop looking.  Then, all of a sudden, the horse is right in front of you and all you have to do is get up the slight incline to where that photo was taken, and then up the [precipitous hill](http://goo.gl/maps/zABFB) on which the horse stands.

So you gear up, you get pumped, you flick forwards to that MASSIVE PRODIGY TUNE you keep filed under """"adrenaline burn"""" in your phone and you POWER DOWN.  Your legs begin to burn but you stretch out, hammering across the road and onto the grass.  The incline ramps up in front of you but your feet are just finding ground sooner to push down as you tear up the hill.  Left, right, left.. your thighs, so powerful a moment before, start to heat up, start to clog with acid.  You try to ignore it, your face contorted and your breath hissing out in strangled gasps.  The incline softens after a hundred yards or so, but it's still hardly flat, so you press on, scraping the very last vestiges of energy from the walls of a calorie store that was empty before you began your crazed assault.

And then, finally, gloriously, you reach the first of the scattered stones at the foot of the horse.  And there's a family there having a picnic as you bend over, snot and sweat streaming from your wretched face as your wracked lungs struggle for sweet, sweet air and, through all the pain, you realise: you've done it!  You made it up to the...

..and at that point a gang of super fit 17 year-olds from the rowing club catch up, nimbly skip over the stones to slap a hand on the horse's pedestal and then, nonchalantly and barely breaking stride, turn 180 degrees and head back to town.

3120,"I have a car insured with them so when I bought a second car I naturally called.  After all they boast they're *the* multi car specialists.  They wanted £550 for the second car, third party only.  Then they realised they hadn't accounted for a claim that I made two years ago when a TNT driver hit my brother's *parked* car while I happened to be responsible for it.  So the premium went up to £650, which for a limited-mileage classic stank of bullshit.  However, being away from home for a few days I went for it so I was legal and paid the £650 upfront.

When I got home I rang a specialist, got a quote for £200 and rang Admiral back.  Being within the 14 days I was entitled to a full refund.  """"Oh yes Mr Pineapplecharm, I will be refunding you the £345.62...""""

It is a profitable company, even though the pricing is exceptionally lower than """"competitors"""". The Royal Mail needs to be a state ran business with all profits put back into the country, not into private interests.

This isn't a stupid move on the part of government, this is an extremely selfish, malicious and self-serving decision. I've yet to hear a single argument as to the benefit of privatizing the Royal Mail.

Try sending a small to medium sized parcel, look at the prices of the Royal Mail then look at other postal companies, that's why the Royal Mail should stay state run, we will lose a postal business that is costs a fraction of other companies.

If you usually stay at or above the limit then you won't see what I'm taking about.

I've noticed the same thing off the highway; if you stick to the limit on a windy, unfamiliar road you will slowly collect a couple of speedy locals behind you but if you're going 5-10 under the limit (e.g. 50 in a 60) you quickly notice people are right up behind you looking to overtake.

3183,"&gt; you should match the speed of the traffic in the lane you're in

Well yes obviously huge trucks which take upwards of a minute to pass each other are incredibly annoying (especially when they end up giving up and pulling back in, always a classic) but I'm talking about an increased level of frustration that is palpable when you drive under the limit.  In fact, I've heard from IAM instructors that driving more than 3mph under the limit is dangerous because it encourages people to take a risk and overtake.  Apparently if you're at the limit they are more likely to think, well, the risk of death *and* points isn't enough to bother.

The point, to me, is just that raising the speed limit increases the expected speed, the normal speed.  Whatever the safety stats say, there isn't a car made which doesn't tail off in efficiency over about 60mph.  Much as I love speed, I also love breathing and not being insanely poor.

As an aside, regarding """"I overtake on public roads at 85mph because it's safer"""" - do you really think for one second that a cop who clicks you doing *25mph over the limit on the wrong side of the road* is going to care about your opinion on road safety?  Enjoy your [on the spot driving ban](http://www.drivingban.co.uk/drivingban/speedingoffences/drivingbanspeedingoffences.htm#What_is_the_penalty_range/maximum_punishment_for_speeding_offences), Mr Clarkson!  If you can't overtake safely at 60 guess what.. *you're not supposed to overtake* and whinging at other people for driving completely legally (but inconveniently slowly for you) when you're happy to boast on the internet about breaking the law is just retarded.

Drive like a dick if you want but don't get sanctimonious about it.  Unless you drive an ambulance.  Do you drive an ambulance?",t1_c4nvzyw,pineapplecharm,0,t1_c4nvllc,c4nvzyw,t3_tm8us,t5_2qhqb,1337009979,c4nvllc,"&gt; If you usually stay at or above the limit then you won't see what I'm taking about. When you do any kind of a long journey at 60, and overtake trucks towing uphill at 55 on a two lane stretch, you definitely get impatient tailgaters who cannot wait for you to get done with their lane. This happens much less when you are around the 70 mark.

A part of safe overtaking is the speed you choose to do it at. This is exeplified on single-lane roads where you need to minimise the time spent on the wrong side of the road (hence why I get a run-up and do it at around 80-85).

It's the same on dual or triple carriageways though - you should match the speed of the traffic in the lane you're in. Although you may be happily chugging along doing 60, if you need to overtake someone doing 55, 5mph isn't really enough closing speed not to inconvenience others (as you're doing less than the average speed for the middle lane, and *dangerously* less than for the overtaking lane).

Actually, shared paternal leave usually does NOT lead to equal time spent with the child. In Iceland we've had a 3-3-3 month paternal leave in place since 2000. That is, 3 months a parent, and 3 months to be shared. After 10 years, the rate of how the leave was split was studied.

Most families(well over 90%) ended up giving ALL of those 3 months to the mother. But on the other hand, over 85% of men took their entire 3 months of their allotted leave, starting within about 20 days of the change of the law, and keeping pretty consistent ever since(with a obvious drop in 2008, but even now, the rate is again somewhere around 80%).

So clearly, men want to spend time with their child, but for whatever reason, be it social norms or some other, nearly always conceded their leave to the mothers. So in late 2012 the law was changed to a 5-2-5 arrangement. There are now 2 months to be split, and they are still sadly believed to end up meaning a essential 5/7 month split, but hopefully in the future that will change.

My suggestion (assuming the existing equipment cannot handle different DHCP scopes and you have to buy something) is that for about $100 you can put a consumer router off the modem that will have a guest SSID on a different VLAN.

To argue otherwise is to drift into saying """"if I'm doing 70 I should just stay in the middle lane"""" and risk ULTRAVIOLENT DEATH.",t1_c4nwonj,pineapplecharm,1,t1_c4nwda7,c4nwonj,t3_tm8us,t5_2qhqb,1337013224,c4nwda7,"&gt; As an aside, regarding """"I overtake on public roads at 85mph because it's safer"""" - do you really think for one second that a cop who clicks you doing 25mph over the limit on the wrong side of the road is going to care about your opinion on road safety? Enjoy your on the spot driving ban, Mr Clarkson! If you can't overtake safely at 60 guess what.. you're not supposed to overtake and whinging at other people for driving completely legally (but inconveniently slowly for you) when you're happy to boast on the internet about breaking the law is just retarded.
&gt; Drive like a dick if you want but don't get sanctimonious about it. Unless you drive an ambulance. Do you drive an ambulance?

Bit of a rant there! The point is that when overtaking, I try to get the deed done as quickly as possible. The most dangerous place to be is on the wrong side of the road.

Similarly, if there were a camera or police car and I did that, then I obviously didn't have enough visibility to attempt the manoeuvre in the first place so I deserve the punishment! :)",t1_c4nwda7,JamesM_,5,t1_c4nvzyw,c4nwda7,t3_tm8us,t5_2qhqb,1337011745
3313,"&gt; provided there is traffic on the left lane that I am passing

This is the key.  Of course all three lanes are there to be used.  However, if there's room for somebody to undertake you and pull back out without crowding your safe stopping distance, you should not have been in the middle or outside lane.

&gt; The only catch here is that every motorist has to know what each lane is for and where they should be in the scheme of things.

This is bullshit, sadly.  Making up """"what each lane is for"""" is just justifying what's convenient for your lazy driving style.  If the lane you're in is holding you up, move right.  If the lane to your left is clear, move left.  It's that simple, and it's in the highway code I quoted above.

Changing lanes, however frequently, isn't dangerous.  If it is, you're doing it wrong.  If anything, constantly watching to see if there's room to pull in - and doing so - keeps your mind on the job.  Banging on the cruise control and zoning out in the middle lane when there's a clear half mile of empty space on the inside lane is much more conducive to being surprised by something unusual.

I think our Venn circles mostly overlap on this.  It's just that you see lane-hogging as a harmless extension of normal behaviour whereas I see it as irritating and dangerous lawbreaking.

Incidentally, your housemate is obviously [Damon Hill](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3NSMx7Ev5A).",t1_c2df4xp,pineapplecharm,2,t1_c2deyhn,c2df4xp,t3_jmmcj,t5_2qh33,1313689282,c2deyhn,"Lets expand on that. 

My ex-house mate drove the way you suggested on a three lane motorway a few weeks ago and by the end of the trip I felt positively sick. Why? Because he was forever dodging left and right to overtake traffic then pull over again. 

Legally he was spot on but practically I think it's far more dangerous. Why? Because aside from making me feel ill he was having to make tens if not hundreds more manoeuvres than everyone around him - constantly changing lanes and merging with traffic (both faster and slower). This radically upped his chances of making a mistake or having an issue with a motorist he didn't see. 

On the other hand there was everyone else - cruising happily with the slowest traffic in the far left hand lane (as it should be), the marginally faster traffic in the central lane and the fastest / overtaking traffic in the right hand lane. No moving all over the road... no rapid acceleration or deceleration... just driving. 

I know which one I would prefer. 

Add to that the effect that if *everyone* is in the left hand lane except to overtake you end up with massive tailbacks as a result of traffic waiting for other traffic to pass, decelerating to merge into the left hand lane and generally trying to fit in. Sure you can overtake in these conditions but it's so much smoother and simpler to spread out and make use of every lane. The only catch here is that every motorist has to know what each lane is for and where they should be in the scheme of things. 

Short version? I'm happy cruising in the central lane of a three lane motorway - provided there is traffic on the left lane that I am passing and faster traffic to my right that is passing me. I won't be in anyones way and will manoeuvre as dictated by motorists around me to ensure I can pass / stay out of other peoples way. No fuss, nice and simple.

This is a bit of a disturbing statement; if you are saying you are willing to put essentials on credit cards to live better...

Using a credit card to cover unexpected budget shortfalls is how a lot of people wind up with debt that takes years to pay off.

Using a credit card to pay for expected budget items (essentials) so that you can up your standard of living means you would be falling deeper into debt every month, and at an accelerating rate because of the interest.

Perhaps there is just a misunderstanding there?

In any case, what are you proposing is precisely how most people that come into large sums of money end up in a WORSE position than before they had it. People get the money, and they buy a house. And they furnish the house, and they buy a nicer car, and they feel like are being frugal with the money because they didn't spend all of it, or most of it, maybe they didn't even spend a quarter of it.

But the problem is that the cost of maintaining the new things is higher than their income, so every year they chip away at that original large sum of money, and every year the income generated by that sum of money goes down. But they think it will be OK, because the figure that the expenses will 'stabilize' and their income will rise and that this will happen before the money runs out.

Instead the expenses only go up, their income doesn't rise as fast as they hope, and then their investments have a bad year, and a few unexpected expenses come up, and suddenly the money is gone, and by the time they sell the house and try to get back to a standard of living their income can afford, they're in debt.",,stampedingTurtles,14,t3_4jpdl4,d38rp1j,t3_4jpdl4,t5_2qstm,1463492983

&gt;you act like """"I'm a late one"""" is somehow a charming character trait, like being funny or having red hair

Lets say you are training to be a teacher and you are assigned a school two trains and a taxi ride away that requires you to be up at 6 **A.M** am, resulting in a winter term of no daylight and 4x35 rebellious teenagers on rotation every day (I was very very lucky to not have a first period lesson), resulting in an average of *4 hours sleep* a night for 6 months through lesson planning and homework marking, which causes you to oversleep and wake up in horror as you launch out of bed and have to run across town for a train, which you cant afford to pay for on your 4k bursary.

Meanwhile all your mates are stitting in a pub at 7pm on friday slagging you off because being late is apparently a deliberately rude thing to do through my personal failure to balance in their  needs, with my own body's demands for sleep. 

If I do make it out, I am apparently boring,  if I dont go, apparently I have better things to do. 


&gt;I was like you for a long time.

&gt;You also get to hear what everyone says about late people before they show up.

If you cant beat em, join em. eh? 

I never used to be like you used to be. And I am not like you now either. 

Also, I am not a teacher either. Not even 30k butsary they offer to train these days would tempt me back into a class full of you lot unless I have control of the curriculum or the birch or you learn the concept of community responsibility.

Still, I do understand your annoyance and I still think the eyeballing was the correct level of attack and no more. I am sorry that you have such a lot of anger left over about the experience, perhaps you could try communicating with your housemate

You need to be there at 7:00 at the *latest* really, some people may disagree but its better to be safe than sorry - the lowco's will leave you behind and make you buy a new ticket if you are late. For all these airports you need to take the underground to a major London train terminus then catch a train out to them.

It's also really pushing it for Heathrow IMO. Heathrow is accessible by the underground direct but its on the outskirts and takes a while. There is also an expensive fast train to central London, but it would quickly deplete a chunk of your budget.

If your flight arrives at 2:00pm then it will probably be 3:00pm before you even get out of the airport. Do you need to collect luggage and then check it in again later? 

So with all that said you probably have more like 3 hours. First read the wiki for some advice. You could have a bit of a walk and catch a few famous landmarks and a bite to eat.

Let you have what?  I'm not rich enough to pick Internet fights with *lawyers*.  Although I would surmise that if being rich wouldn't save me from ignorance of American law then being British, and a resident in London, might help me a little bit.  At least you're less of a stereotypical legal twatburger than your pizza-named colleague over there.

The rather sad part of this sort of thing is that at a macro level the entire legal system exists, at least in part, precisely to stop big tough rich people from simply stomping all over everyone else.  500 years ago if you were Lord of the manor and some peasant pissed you off, he would have just had you killed - because what the fuck was your widow going to do about it?  Now we've put in all the framework to make even the most powerful accountable for their actions... and then paid clever bastards like you handsomely to undermine the whole thing.  Bloody marvellous.

Lord knows you could have let me have it - I certainly pulled no punches.

&gt; So, just to be clear, this means AirBnB and its users can't take each other to court for any reason? So if AirBnB are somehow found guilty in a court of criminal negligence that has cost a user money they would only have recourse individually through arbitration, and there's legal precedent for that being upheld? Blimey. That's quite a heavy click I'd be making there.

There is a lot here, so I'll break it down:

1. You can still enter lawsuits to get injunctions, just not to go after money damages.
2. Criminal law is just totally outside of the scope of this stuff. If airbnb is found criminally negligent then it is going to wind up in court no matter what - but this doesn't matter for you as a private citizen. Governments sue for criminal negligence, not private citizens, and yes, in fact, if Airbnb were found to be criminally liable for damage the civil suit *might* still be dead in the stable because of this clause. It may vary slightly from state to state and on the type of damage alleged, but yes, this is the whole point, and criminally responsible parties can still be found not to have civil liability specifically for these reasons. Again, that is going to vary a lot - but the odds of any of this stuff rising to the level of criminality is very low anyway. 
* In general, yes, the only recourse is individually through binding arbitration. Whether or not this means Airbnb users can sue each other is something I haven't really thoughtabout - its a definite """"maybe / I don't know.""""
* As above, there are exceptions, but there is a truckload of caselaw upholding this in all sorts of circumstances where even I, as a soulless suit, have thought """"damn, that's harsh."""" For instance, binding arbitration and waiver of class action has been upheld against walmart in systematic workers sexual discrimination lawsuits - which is just... sanity-blasting to me. Additionally, binding arbitration has been upheld as a matter of routine in *clickwrap* contracts which is also very worrisome to me - and it has been upheld in all manner of gruesome cases of personal injury, enormous financial losses and property damage.
* Yes, it **is** a heavy click - but don't worry, dotcomrade! Strong odds are that you've already made that click several times *today.* Reddit, twitter and facebook don't appear to have it - but I can assure you that many, many, many websites do.

* Visitors to the garden bridge in London will be tracked by their mobile phone signals and supervised by staff with powers to take people’s names and addresses and confiscate and destroy banned items, including kites and musical instruments

*  a prohibition on any exercise other than jogging, playing a musical instrument, taking part in a “gathering of any kind”, giving a speech or address, scattering ashes, releasing a balloon and flying a kite.

* An “enhanced” CCTV system would monitor visitors for lawbreaking or prohibited activities

*  security staff known as """"visitor hosts"""" who would have limited policing powers under a Community Safety Accreditation Scheme, including the right to issue fines.

*  bag searches or “wand” scans of people’s clothing could be used, but only, for example, if a VIP was visiting the bridge.

* The bridge would close overnight, and occasionally in evenings, for private events.

* the bridge would be off limits to groups of eight or more people and to cyclists.

*  the charity proposes to rent the rooftop of the bridge's landing podium for commercial purposes on every weekend between May and October.

The poacher who is mean but generous, the uncle who is generous but demanding, the career that brings grinding failure and sudden success - these are all hallmarks of the hapless teenage experience.

As you get older however most of us move out of this world. We make our own luck, and instead of farcical escapades we experience achievement and progress. We maintain our cars, we plan our meals ahead, we don't get drunk during the day just because we have £20 to burn and pick fights with strangers. On the one hand we don't find ourselves cowering in bed expecting to be murdered but on the other we generate fewer completely insane anecdotes.

""""Due diligence"""" and """"common sense"""" are basically useless, which are what gun control is. It doesn't matter if people have rocket launchers or machine guns. It only matters WHO has them.

The reality is, when you put a gun in someone's possession, you have removed from your trust a grave responsibility and put it into another person's trust. 

If someone wants a gun, they will try to get one, regardless of their fitness to hold this trust or their motive. The only place where rational incentives and trust can possibly hold is with the seller. 

If you sell your AR-15 to a guy in the classifieds without any investment into his character, history, family, friends, etc, then you are literally no better than the retired cop who sold the gun to the Orlando nut, who literally said “He’s a nobody. He’s a customer. He came and purchased his guns and he left. We do a large business.” 

We hand over killing tools with less concern than we hand over medicine or car keys. We have the entire picture backwards. Killers will not be disincentivized by the law's punishment.

It sucked balls to have moved away and failed and I was desperate to do anything that got me back on an independent path. By happy accident (nobody else applied) I got offered a job running a retail website for a decent size retail chain here in the UK (200 shops).  The problem? My PHP was basic,  my CSS was not much beyond the :hover attribute and I knew no MySQL. I repeat: I did not know what a select statement was. And yet here I was taking sole technical responsibility for the website of a multi-million pound a year company. Out of my depth? Fuck,  I had to go to store manager meetings with 200 guys who'd fought their way to manager status at the sharp end of retail, despite my having never picked up a price gun in my life. I shook with fear at the idea one of them would ask what my background was.

I could have been honest and owned up to my shortcomings. But at the time I was adamant that I would do anything not to go back to my parents' spare room and I simply threw myself into learning as fast as I could so that I could overtake the minimum knowledge level required to do my job before I got fired.

However in most of Africa, vehicles are often in a poor state of repair with bald tyres, shot shocks and the like, as well as being regularly overloaded with unsecured passengers, which makes anything other than straight-line progress highly risky.

High speed roads are also better isolated from pedestrian traffic - I've *never* seen livestock or people (except those who have pulled over) on the motorway in Europe but I've seen cows, horses and drunken pedestrians stumbling into the path of 70mph traffic many times in countries south of the Med.

While it is of course possible to dream up a situation where this sort of decision might have to happen on the Autobahn, I think it's much more an edge case than in rural Africa, as evidenced by the lack of *exhortation to commit deliberate manslaughter* in the government-issued driving instruction literature, certainly here in the UK.

The feel of them around my neck is one of the most deeply unpleasant sensations. I constantly feel like I'm about to be choked.

The last time I wore a tie was when I was delivering an educational presentation for the company which then employed me. The next time I wore a shirt with a mandarin collar* to make it very, VERY clear that I had not forgotten to wear a tie, I was consciously refusing to.

Did the presence of a tie improve my performance? Quite the opposite. I felt more confident and alert without 20% of my mind being taken up by a little voice screaming """"GET THAT NOOSE OFF YOUR NECK BEFORE SOMEONE CHOKES YOU!""""

Then it was shoes. My current employer requires I wear 'smart shoes' Again, I refuse. Walking in normal shoes is awkward for me. The majority of them destroy my feet. I get unbalanced easily too. So I wear boots. Big ones. Millsurp for preference. I know where I'm putting my feet, they're comfortable and they are more respectable than trainers (which I also don't wear).

It seemed to be a bit of an issue at first but I keep my boots clean. Did not having fancy footwear impact my work? Well if my last review and pay rise are anything to go by - no.

If you want someone representing your company, it's perfectly reasonable to expect them to look smart, respectable and professional. However a dress code is a cheap, nasty little fools errand to achieve that. I'm a grown man. I know how to dress myself. I know how to dress for a given occasion. I don't need my employer to spoon feed me on how to look and act like a professional as I am a professional.

And I'm a far better professional who represents the better qualities of my employer when I wear an open neck (or mandarin) shirt and a pair of clodhoppers. When I wear a tie and shoes I'm a fidgety mess who needs an extra few seconds to answer every question, trips over his own feet and gets easily distracted.

And that's with 'normal' shoes. I find it absurd that a woman should be expected to wear something as uncomfortable, impractical, and downright unhealthy as high heels.

If you want people to look professional, hire professionals. If you want to hire a face, hire that face. Dress policies are mostly an attempt to paint a company to look like something that it may well not be.

*Hate ties as well? Get one of these and see if you can get away with it.

*Edit*

Wow, some people have really strong feelings about people who don't like dress codes. 

Anyway, it's been fun responding to these comments. No idea why not wearing a tie seems to piss some of you off so much, but my lunch break's over and I have to deliver some training.

Alternatively, if I need to buy one, is this level of routing called something for which I can check the specs?

The tills / office are all wired in (through the switch) so there's no security problem *yet*, as long as the router doesn't allow traffic between the WAP and the office IP range.  I will investigate further once I get up there.",t1_c4j5ckt,pineapplecharm,1,t1_c4j3z2u,c4j5ckt,t3_t3105,t5_2qkaf,1335964671,c4j3z2u,"I don't know your set up so you would have to provide more information on what exact you are working with. For example """"some standard box"""" doesn't tell us if its a switch, router, modem, firewall, etc. 

On to your question. There are multiple ways to do this. I'm going to say what I think is the easiest (doesn't mean it's the best).

But assuming """"some standard box"""" is a router, you can just purchase a wireless access point. Remember each port on a router has the ability to act as a different network. The purpose of a router is to join multiple networks together.

Port 1 can be 192.168.0.0-192.168.0.255 

port 2 can be 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255

port 3 can be 192.168.2.0-192.168.2.255

So essentially you are creating two networks with 1 router. 

In your case, you would keep the router's wifi on and give that an address range. Then have a port plug into a WAP and give that a range as well. Of course a different range than the first wifi. Or you can stick a toe in the water and make subnets.

Since you are wireless, the question becomes how well will your router play along? It should work fine I believe but can't make any promises. I'm only thinking conceptually. 


Now the 1 million dollar question you should be asking your boss is what about security? You are already wireless. At this point it doesn't matter if they are on the same network or not. Your data is already in the air for anyone to grab. That means credit card numbers, tax info, etc. Anything that is important should not be wireless. Technically as it stands now, your data can be grabbed out of the air. Unless you are using WPA2 AES or something, you run the risk of a data breach (even then no promises). 

Plus now you must also consider how this affects network traffic. If your network already has an issue with speed for the basic business stuff, then adding on more clients who will be using data like crazy (youtube, itunes, files) can slow down the whole network depending on how you go about this.


As for the firewall idea if I'm understanding how you are planning to set that up, it can work. Probably more hassle then it needs to be. In that case you would need 1 NIC and 2 wifi cards and all your traffic would have to be routed through Pfsense. Then pfsense becomes your DHCP host because each network is it's own thing. Then this goes back to how you are currently set up. This can also add another bottle neck. 

So like I said before I'm only think conceptually. You have to give us specifics on how your network is currently laid out. Not asking for model numbers but what connects in to what, how it is connected, what devices are present, etc.",t1_c4j3z2u,gex80,1,t3_t3105,c4j3z2u,t3_t3105,t5_2qkaf,1335950292

So a few updates, given the interest in the fairly useless .jpg I posted yesterday. There are around 450 pubs inside the M25 rated 4.3 stars or higher via Google Reviews. You can access the list with names and addresses [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WBUM98X6WOHV70QI1pcOp6piaxf-iQpGWIG7DAo-yyM/edit?usp=sharing) and download the KML file, whatever that might mean, [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2eCGD3jKlpfU1ZHYnd5aXNmQkU/view?usp=sharing). Not the ratings themselves, annoyingly, because that's not how it works.

**""""Why 4.3?""""** 

It's closer to 4.5 (a solid 9/10) than 4.2, and I found a 4.2 pub I've been to that was rubbish. 

**""""What if the same can be said for a shit pub inexplicably rated 4.6?""""**

I know!

**""""If the 4.3 rating is given by a wildly different number of presumably very different people for each pub, how can you put them all in the same map and say they're equivalently worthy?""""** 

Good question. Tourists, hipsters, native Londoners, new-to-town graduates, will have their own take on any given pub. I think you end up with an idea of local taste if not an objective scale.

**""""Do you have any further insights that you picked up whilst making this?""""**

I found it interesting that I could find at least one pub in every area of London, for example The Star on South Hill Avenue in Harrow which otherwise seems to be a wasteland of average pubs. 

There are 13 Kings (4 Queens), 4 Princes (2 Princesses), 3 Crowns, 7 Lords, 6 """"Royal""""s, 7 Dukes (1 Duchess), 9 Lions (8 Red, 1 White), 3 Coach &amp; Horses, 3 Greyhounds and 3 Swans.

3747,"Good points well made. But it's more nuanced than that. The suggestion isn't to call it """"pratchettium"""", it's to use a name for a magical, intangible substance which happens to fit the appropriate naming schema. I don't recall anything similar even in Feynman's entertaining pontification. 

I get what you're saying about honouring great scientists but by the same logic we'd only have economists on bank notes. It's a great opportunity not just to honour a great person but to reference something recognisable from popular culture. When I were a lad my junior school named the years/grades after a different theme each academic year. Famous architects,  or geological eras for example. At the time they were just words but when I came across them later in my childhood you can bet I was the only twelve year-old in the room whose ears pricked up at the mention of Palladio or Silurian.

This is an element so fleeting in nature that we got to 2015 before someone managed to create one atom of it. I'm sure it will be of interest to an elite class of physicists but to the rest of us,  who invest in such research through our taxes and University fees,  it's hard to see its relevance. Not taking the opportunity to make people engage with such breakthroughs is a mistake.  I submit that the naming of it is more about making science familiar and interesting than a strict league table of hero worship, and the opportunity presented by this specific confluence of name, meaning and nature is too good to pass up.

I've read several of the Discworld books and I love them, but this is a stretch. There are some funny references to scientific principles and experiments, but I wouldn't say the books convey any meaningfully deep knowledge of science; certainly not enough to warrant Pratchett's immortalisation alongside Curie, Einstein, Fermi, Bohr, Mendeleev, Rutherford, Röntgen, Copernicus *et al.*. Their discoveries have provided meaningful insight into the way nature works and have advanced entire fields of study; the impact they have had on modern science has been profound. They weren't chosen for making people vaguely aware of science, but for changing the way we think about the universe. 

Terry, whilst being an incredibly entertaining writer and offering some clever critique and satire on society, hasn't contributed to our understanding of natural phenomena in any meaningful way. As much as I am a fan, I think it would be wholly inappropriate to name an element after him. I think it would be much more appropriate to pay tribute to him in a way that was related to his contributions to the world; i.e. naming some kind of literature prize, or library or something relating to one of his genuine interests (arguably the GNU Terry Pratchett, the sea turtle fossil that's named after him, maybe some astronomical object would be appropriate). 

Whilst Schrödinger and Feynman and Planck and Darwin and Maxwell and others remain without elements in the periodic table, it wouldn't be fitting to start naming them after authors of popular fiction. ",,FezojT,15,t1_cyranqt,cyrd4pa,t3_402rpa,t5_2qhqb,1452304870

Using that definition, I don't think they've gotten their numbers right.

The median annual income in Westminster is £35,200. Assuming that someone working part time earns half of that (£17,600/year), you have a total income of £52,800/year between two people. You shouldn't be spending more than 1/3 of your income on accommodation, meaning this couple have £1467/month to spend on accommodation. That won't afford you a two-bed penthouse by the river, but that budget is not unheard of in the northern parts of the borough.

Shelter is saying that the cost of renting is ~~50% higher than the (total) combined take home pay, meaning £6,600/month for our average couple~~ higher than 50% of the (total) combined take home pay, meaning £2,200, or £1,759.94 after tax as /u/cyclegaz mentions (I wasn't aware that my initial figures were pre-tax).

For someone who is actively looking for a job, the skill list is basically a SEO keyword list for HR departments and recruiting agencies, who might be absolutely clueless about what all the various abbreviations mean. This doesn't mean the company looking for talent is clueless or bad either, it's simply difficult to find really good developers and many of them have to resort to agencies that can give them leads.

They have a stack of words associated with the projects the company is doing and look for candidates who have experience with them. The actually relevant details of your profile (e.g. work experience, projects) won't matter if you never show up, or are deep in the list when it comes to candidate relevancy.

Should the HR ask a developer to check your LinkedIn profile (which isn't always the case anyway), they focus in what you've worked on and what your interests are, if you've got a Github link etc, not if you've listed something in the skills section that isn't necessarily a skill.

Is JSON a keyword that appears in many talent searches? I don't know, but if you have room and need a job, there's no harm in including it for maximum visibility. You could have the exact same argument over a bunch of libraries and tools as well. If you are very concerned over how the skill list portrays you, drop the nonsense to the bottom and hide any endorsements from them to make the important bits stand out.

Overall LinkedIn is mostly a bullshit circlejerk where people endorse each other to stand out and try to look important, but it has proven incredibly valuable in finding developer talent/jobs, so it's a good idea to bite the bullet and SEO the shit out of your profile when you look for a job.

Let's say you arrange to meet your mate at 7pm and you know it takes about half an hour to get there.  If you aim to leave the house at 6:30 you are already late.  Seriously, it's two days before and you've already made the decisions that will lead to you being late.  Because if you reach a natural break in what you're doing come 6:15 you won't leave the house and be early, you'll start some other horseshit task, and come 6:35 you'll still be looking for your fucking shoes instead of being on the bus already.  And then you're late, and your mate who did leave at 6:15 is sat there reading the adverts on the tube platform, or defending his solo occupancy of a table in a crowded pub, until your sweaty, stressed-out self shows up.

Being late is a form of selfishness; it's rude not to value others' scheduled time over your flexible time.  When you refuse to run the risk of being early, because you can totally just squeeze in something before you leave, you're guaranteeing you will always be late.

I was like you for a long time, constantly making up bullshit excuses and exaggerating about the District Line not showing up, all because I couldn't even entertain the thought of standing around waiting for someone else like a loser.  Carrying a Kindle helped me a lot; I would look forward to being ten or fifteen minutes early to things because I'd get to read my book for a bit.  And not being """"a late one"""" changes your life; it's incredibly liberating when the tube is delayed on the way to something important and you can relax about it and consider your options instead of being torn apart by miserable self loathing.

I would normally have been on Piccadilly Line from Kings Cross to Piccadilly Circus at time that bomb went off. When I got to my home station St Albans - trains were running late, so I didn't make it to Kings Cross in time to get caught up in the blast. Never been so thankful to Thameslink for their delays. 

When we got to Kentish Town we were told that service was halting there due to power problems. I got off train and tried to call my boss to say I was going to be late. No Vodafone signal. No tube either so I was still cursing transport. Jumped on a bus. Weird but in those days smartphones weren't very common so I still didn't have a clue what was going on. Then someone on the bus got a call and they said """"The put a bomb on a bus. I better get off then"""". I knew something was wrong then. The bus stopped at Great Portland Street, and there were sirens ambulances and police cars everywhere. I knew then something very bad indeed had happened to London. Felt a little tear at that point.

Still no Vodafone and a queue for every phonebox (I know 11 years ago but a different world) so just walked to the office in Regent Street. Came through the door, and the MD crossed himself. I was the last unaccounted for member of staff. I asked my colleague what the deal was and he said there had been bombs at every tube station and there were two jumbo jets in the sky poised to hit London at any second. Bizarelly - terrible as the situation was it turned out not to be as bad as he said it was. He was big into conspiracy theories, so was going on about likely causes all day. 

Half way through the afternoon the MD said go home, so I walked back to Kentish Town. Strangely the West End had an air of normality, shops were open, and in Camden Town street drinkers carried on about their business as if nothing had happened. When I got to Kentish Town there were hundreds of people trying to get home, and in typical Thameslink style were complaining to staff about delays and lack of information. I went mad and started shouting at them. """"At least you'll get home - which is more than some poor bastards will be doing. Now shut up and let the rail guy get on with his job"""" I felt as if I was in some film about the Blitz to be honest but it needed to be said.

Eventually got back to St Albans earlier than usual and saw Cathedral flag at half mast. Really hit me then and started weeping. Got home and my kids said """"What a great day - dads home early to watch ChittyChittyBangBang"""" watched it with them and felt amazingly grateful just to be alive.

I talk to my parents about things I remember like this all the time and they barely ever know what I'm  talking about.

I was generally pretty well-behaved as a kid but one time when my Dad came home from a business trip to New York he brought back a Hardy Boys book for my brother and a Nancy Drew book for me (I'm a guy...) so I threw the book on the floor and made a big deal of how it was for girls and was a stupid present. 

Another time, we had planned for ages to go see Home Alone 2, and I was super excited. The day we were supposed to go, it snowed really heavily and my Dad said it would be better not to go as he thought the car might not be able to handle it (I grew up in a remote area and the nearest cinema was 45mins away through a fairly hilly area.) 

So, I start crying and yelling, saying """"you promised!!"""" over and over again and eventually my Dad gives in. Halfway there, the car breaks down and we're stuck in the middle of nowhere in the freezing cold for ages. The car gets towed, and costs a huge amount to get fixed. We get a lift home from my aunt and don't get to see Home Alone 2 so I continue to complain like a little shit.

In my head over the years I let memories of these things grow into a big guilt bubble and would feel really bad, like it was this horrific moment in my Dad's parenting life, but when I eventually brought it up with him he said he didn't even remember about the book and that he was preoccupied at the time because he got sick on the trip, and only vaguely remembered the car story!

No, it didn't. Homesite was one of the first casualties in a long line of web related products that Adobe mismanaged and mangled.

I personally continued using Homesite long after Adobe stopped supporting it. DW was not cutting it, even back then. 

It was Macromedia which made all of the innovations. I can only surmise the corporate culture at Adobe forced out the original talent, as the existing mindset systematically ruined everything web related to this day. 

Flash continued to thrive for a short while, in spite of Adobe, not because of it. It's current obsolete status and fervent abandonment by the web development community is indicative of Adobe's product development. 

DreamWeaver exists only because of its packaging with Adobe's mainstay programs, like cable channels you happen to watch because they're included, and a small outlier of developers addicted to its """"Site management"""" feature.

You don't have absolute control over others but if you have an interest in them being who they say they are and behaving how they promise to behave then you will sure as shit take more care over dealing with such people.

When you sell something privately you're only worrying about yourself - will this guy pay me, will I get a good price, whatever.

If you have kids at a local school you'll be much twitchier about a miserable goth kid looking to buy .  But if you're childless then you might not think much of it because it doesn't affect you directly.  The threat of a conviction might just make you a bit more invested in a good outcome from the sale and make you more careful.

Those of us who work with potentially dangerous goods or people have to take some of the responsibility for reducing the danger.  Cool off periods and background checks are great but they're also box-ticking which I'm sure some unscrupulous retailers treat as an annoyance rather than a useful tool to help make society safer.

&gt; You acknowledge and agree that you and Airbnb are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding. 

To break it down:

&gt; You acknowledge and agree that you and Airbnb are each waiving (i) the right to a trial by jury or (2) to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding.

However, that doesn't affect the fact that class action waivers, waivers of jury trials and agreements to binding arbitration are totally valid and binding and there is tons and tons and tons of caselaw to support this.

&gt; I certainly read it this way and this possibly set me off in the wrong direction thinking it is trying to preclude any court action whatsoever which is obviously not the case.

It **is** the case and it *works.* You have agreed to arbitration - and that is it. In fact, there is even [federal law stating that this is okay - The Federal Arbitration Act.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Arbitration_Act)

So yes - you *are* reading that right. **By using the service you waive your right to sue in a court of law or to join a class action law suit.** That's how that is intended to work and how it *does* work.

It was my first smartwatch, but the always on screen, water resistance, low price, and simplicity are what made me choose Pebble. I wondered if I would be better off with a newer model that had the color screen and microphone, but was happy enough with the classic. Then, three days in, I got the infamous screen tearing. Contacted support, and a week later they are sending a replacement. In the meantime, I started looking around, and decided to buy the standard Time. I don't want to deal with being without a watch for a couple weeks at a time if the screen tearing happens again, and figured the new features might be worth it. I've had the time for about three days now as well. Overall, I'd say it's a tough choice. The microphone works well, with the glaring exception of being able to dictate some names or local slang. The color display is nice, but honestly I went back to using the clock face I had on the classic (Modern), and don't even notice the color screen all that much when using apps. Pebble health is really nice however, and in my limited use seems better than both Misfit and Plexfit. That alone is nearly worth the upgrade. The microphone is nice, but I personally have limited occasions where it is appropriate to use, and have more than a couple friends whose names it cannot recognize. It feels much better on the wrist than the classic. Smaller, and with a more comfortable stock band. The buttons are a step backwards however. The smaller size means that there's no longer room for space between the 3 side buttons, and instead of instinctively being able to tell which one I'm pressing, I often second guess myself and have to look. They also don't press nearly as nice. The classic had a great snappy press with its buttons. The Time is much """"mushier"""". I can push it halfway down with some force, and then have to push even harder to get it to actually register. The classic was just a simple single pressure down with a satisfying click when it was pushed. Lastly, i feel as though the Time has more animations in 3.8 than the classic. They take more time and seem less polished than some of the hard cuts from one screen to anther on the classic. In particular i dislike the folding spiderweb transition when going back to your watch face. Overall though, I would say it's worth the upgrade to the Time, even if it's not for the 'major' features like a color screen and microphone. It's the comfort and Pebble health that really does it for me. Software can always be changed, and hopefully future generations of the Pebble can fix my gripes with the buttons. Good luck with your decision though! Hope I was able to help even with my limited time with both.

Edit: About the viewing angles: I can't compare them side by side since my classic Pebble is unusable with the screen tearing and I haven't gotten the replacement yet, but I haven't noticed a huge difference. I would agree that it's not quite as good, but nothing i probably would have noticed enough to complain about. The screen colors from just the backlight are pretty abysmal though. Normal daylight is great, but at night my reds become a very washed out magenta and the rest of the spectrum looks like pastels.

It was a different city back then - it changed dramatically block-by-block, even in Midtown. We walked from Battery City to Upper East Side one day and it was like walking across planet Earth. We met Quentin Crisp, and he took us to the movies and drinks afterwards. 

It's changed massively since, become more homogeneous, much safer. Last time I was there (2014) we sat drinking craft beer and eating fries with shaved truffle on the sidewalk on Frederick Douglass Bvd. I wouldn't have walked up there in 88.

And, what's more, it's by far the most comprehensive mass transit system in the US. And it's very cheap. 

The roads are in a terrible state and always have been. The huge metal plates bolted onto the surface where repairs have become impossible. The Subway was built very shallow, which can't help, and neither does the extreme climates. For the world's premier city, it does indeed feel very ramshackle - but the US is predominantly scruffy and poorly maintained, with bubbles of immaculateness here and there. That even goes for super rich cities like San Francisco, let alone Baltimore. Airport-wise, JFK has improved massively (it used to be TERRIBLE! The duty free used to be a kiosk where you would choose from a catalogue, pay, and they'd bring the stuff to the plane. We were delayed once, and the only eating at 11pm was a Pizza Hut with pepperoni or plain cheese. And they'd run out of pepperoni. No booze at all). Last time we came back from EWR which was bland but clean, efficient, and the BA lounge superb. The cab drivers are rude and barely speak English (so I felt quite homesick!) but they are everywhere at every hour of the day. Never waited more than 3 mins, even in the small hours.

We have been trying to curb this behavior and she doesn't do it with people she interacts daily with but at the dog park, if there is a new person there  that happens to be leaning down, you can bet they are about to get a faceful of Beanie. Just the other day there was a young 3 year old boy wandering around the park and my girl loves kids, absolutely adores them. They are on her level so she generally doesn't jump up at them but she will run circles about them, bump them on the butt and occasionally nip a heel. This kid came up behind Sabine, jumped and screamed at her, which startled my dog to turn around and jump at the kid which knocked the kid on to the sidewalk and caused him to get a cut on his head when it hit. 

I was freaking out. Thankfully I had a few witnesses so when the mom came huffing and puffing, I had a few other people point to the rules saying that no children under the age of 12 are allowed to be in the park at all. She still screamed a little about her child and how poorly trained my dog is. I'm sorry, yeah, my dog is a bit rambunctious and she is a mess. I've been working with her trying to get her to not be as jumpy. But, your kid is the one who startled my dog in the dog park where children are not supposed to be. I don't bring my dogs to the kiddie park, don't bring your kids to the dog park.

I don't know what would happen had your girl bit the boy but I feel like no children should be allowed in the dog park. Hell, I don't think a lot of people should be allowed to be in the dog park.

1. Nutrition
2. Physical Comfort
3. Emotional Encouragement

First one is kinda easy. Figure out what she normally uses while training and bring some of that. Also bring some snacks that she likes to normally eat. Depending on weather, have ice or hot chocolate on hand. If you want to be a super star, have small portions of comfort food, so for me, a slice of hot pizza. You do have to be careful about how much you let them eat. And to get them back on the road.

For physical comfort, bring a spare change of clothes and a changing towel. It's cheap insurance in case of rain, gravel, dirt, etc. Aside from that, chammy butter and anti chaffing items are great. Also just some basic first aid stuff like anti itch cream. Wet wipes too! So that they can be clean if they want. A water jug big enough to actually wash hands and face are also great. 

And emotional comfort... just be encouraging. It sometimes sucks to be in a supporting role waiting hours just to see your partner for 5 minutes at a time. Bring enough stuff to keep yourself busy and happy. Because when you are unhappy, it can translates over to the rider which will sit in their minds. Ask them what they want to do, do they want to finish the ride. But don't force them, it has to be their choice and your role is to keep them grounded and remove unneeded stresses from them.

Bonus credit tidbit, when snacking from the giant bag of goodies you'll likely have, try to not eat the last of any given item. Obsessing over food is pretty common, and can be soul shattering when you arrive to not find it. I may or may not still hold a slight grudge at somebody who ate my cold, 6 hour old burger.

4404,"Not quite.  Thing is, a massive increase in business is fine, as long as it's at a profitable price point and it continues afterwards.  Plenty of businesses not only survive a massive rush but change gear and thrive on it.  The problem with Groupon was that it ticked neither of these boxes.  First, the massive rush was at 25% of the normal price (minimum discount 50%, then Groupon take half of what's left) so although you could get economies of scale they would have to be pretty drastic for you not to come out making a loss.  Even that would be surviveable, however, if you converted any of the new customers into long-term profitable prospects.  But the second problem with Groupon is that doesn't happen.  If the first time you come to the spa you're paying £25 for a massage, there is no way in hell you're coming back to get the same thing for £50.

If a big company has excess stock to shift, or needs to get its name out there with some kind of gimmicky one-off, Groupon might possibly work.  But, as their own repeat business was practically nonexistent with business owners realising quickly that it wasn't worth the effort, Groupon marketed themselves ever more aggressively onto tiny, boutique and hand-made style local businesses who just got flattened by the worthless demand.

The worst part is, the one tiny ray of light of getting all that money upfront (i.e. so you can actually buy all this bulk stock you're going to need) didn't exist - the business saw nothing without collecting valid coupon codes and typing them into Groupon's website.  This took a lot of time on top of everything else and also meant that every person who bought a Groupon and didn't cash it in was lining Groupon's pockets without benefitting the poor business owner who'd now maxed out her credit card buying in stock that wasn't getting paid for.

It's a diseased and horrible business model which they almost seem to have gone out of their way to make as toxic as possible.

The service and reviews of groupons deals is very poor. Many times the business was totally overwhelmed, understaffed, and at times never communicated to their own employees that they launched a groupon. If you take a quiet spa or hair salon and suddenly increase demand 2000%, you're going to have some serious problems. You can't get people booked on time, you can't deal with the constant phone calls and walk-ins, service is rushed to accomoodate growing lines, staff is stressed tremendously and customer service fails. Meanwhile everyone who didn't get exactly what they wanted is bashing your business online and through word of mouth. Your brand is beng destroyed.

The hand brake is designed to be applied when the car is stopped, to keep it stopped. Nothing more. As regards failure, modern cars have dual circuits hooked up to diagonal pairs of wheels so if one fails you still have at least some braking at the front. If there was any question of the so-called e-brake ever being used to stop the car it would be hooked up to the front wheels.

In the extremely unlikely event of total hydraulic brake failure, engine braking is a hugely superior strategy. Not only are many cars front wheel drive but, in those that aren't, you won't lock up the rear as the hand brake would do.

**If your brakes fail, hit low gear. This will slow the car enormously without robbing you of control.**

Edit: to be fair, both previous replies are probably be saying it's designed *in such a way that it would* work without the hydraulics, rather than deliberately *to* work in such a situation.

4495,"&gt; It is of course entirely Claire’s choice how many children she has. She can pop out another 14 for all I care. That’s her business. The only time I get to put my tuppence worth in is when Claire and her husband expect me, as a taxpayer, to pay for their choices.

""""I'm sorry, but..."""" by any other name.",,pineapplecharm,1,t1_cv6rmdr,cv73f0l,t3_3li0ep,t5_2qhqb,1442685435,cv6rmdr,"I agree entirely with this. It's having the rug pulled out from underneath you. Going on the basis that any type of funding or employment could disappear without warning, no one would be having kids at all because it'd be a huge risk.

This paragraph in the article sums up the views of the author to me:

""""For starters, Claire and her husband won’t see their income “plummet” when tax credits are cut. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that the maximum loss to any family from the changes next April will be £1,000 a year – a big number for low-income families, yes, but hardly what most people would call “plummeting”. """"

£25k a year and losing around £80 to £100 a month is fucking devastating. I'd have struggled with that loss back when I was earning that much. Christ, rent in the capital was around £950 a month for me and my partner back when we were earning that much....who knows how much it is now?!

You'd get roughly (and I mean roughly) £1,674 a month after tax...they need a property big enough for 5 children and themselves so at least a 3 bedroom house to rent, in London, would be fucking impossible to afford...so let's assume they are spending something like £750 a month to live outside London somewhere, as a modest guess...that leaves them with about £900 a month, let's take off some bills....gas...leccy....at the cheaper end, £50 a month each if they're frugal? My utilities are more like £140 a month so I'm again being very modest with guessing...this leaves £800, then food....who knows what they are spending trying to hopefully eat healthily - I spend roughly £70 a week on food and it's just me, and my wife - no kids...let's say it's £50 a week and I'm just an anomaly (I'm really, really understating these figures)...they're left with £600 but the chances are at this point they're really left with like £300...then they have council tax...band C property at LEAST...modest guess again £140 a month....could be left with anywhere between £400 to £0 a month...who fucking knows...the point is...the kids need clothes, they need emergency funds, occasional dental work, all sorts of shit and I can already see how £25k isn't going to keep that family floating. And then they lose £100 of that monthly income to this shit...and we're not allowed to feel sorry for them or see this as bad?!

Anyway I'm just thinking out loud, there's loads of shit I haven't covered but this article approaches £25k for a family of 5 as a lot of money?! I know I'm forgetting her part time wage which will top it up but this article fucking pretends they're rolling in it.

And referring to her as """"Corbyn's friend"""" already tells me something about the bias this shit has bubbling under the surface. Perhaps they could have asked her what her monthly finances look like to get a better picture?

Take the Daily Mail, for example, which equally shames and publicises practically any woman with a bit of cleavage, while the red tops in particular have a total lack of any male equivalent.

It's just another ingredient in what effectively functions as a way of making women more self conscious whilst depicting them as caricatured objects for men's pleasure. The NMP3 campaign is basically trying to tackle just a small part of the problem, because this entire ideology is pretty hard to try and take down all at once.

My personal problem with page three is that I can't think of a solid reason why it should stay, as it's negatives far outweigh the positives. And in a society where we now have a constant flow of arousing material online, it's certainly not necessary by any means to feature it on the inside cover of a newspaper, and as a country, we won't be missing out by not having this """"staple"""" feature. Those that want to ogle at boobs everyday have plenty of outlets to do so for free, and I feel that their arguments for it to feature in this particular context fall flat as a result.

Full story: in 1997 I went to the RHPS *every* Friday night for about two months.  It was ridiculous but in my defence the show used to be amazing; each scene on screen was acted out very enthusiastically by real live people on the stage and if you were in the front row you'd get water / underwear / lab coats on you as a matter of course.  During *There's a Light* they would encourage people to unfold the newspaper from their prop pack to shelter from the staff squirting everyone with water pistols from the balcony.

Anyway, one night I went with rowdy school friends and decided to up the ante.  I wore my best drag outfit and a huge overcoat, underneath which was my little sister's full-on Super Soaker.  Pumping with adrenaline, I smuggled that thing right into the auditorium and, just as Brad and Janet were getting their bedraggledest, I leaped up out of my seat, pumped my weapon and let fly with a full on crowd-control water cannon barrage.

Unfortunately, in my drunken enthusiasm I had failed to inspect the balcony carefully and my ebullient hosing hit their high powered spotlight, causing a small cloud of steam and a distinct dimming of the light as the lens cracked.  Within seconds the ushers had rushed me, divested me of my sister's gun and escorted me from the auditorium.  Barely ten minutes into the film I found myself deposited back into Leicester Square alone, unarmed and in full Anne Summers style drag.

I waited about fifteen minutes before, realising my friends weren't coming, sloping off for a pint.  I'd love to say I was the centre of attention but when a skinny boy in a suspender belt orders a pint of Guinness at the Moon Under Water you'd be surprised at how wide a berth he gets.

4890,"&gt; their oil change was more expensive than a Chevy Cruze

This made me laugh.  My Dad once got stung for about £400 by a Volvo dealer for an oil change and you can definitely buy a car for that.

IIRC he refused to pay and they pretended to drain and refill with something more reasonable.  Sharks, man!",t1_cs1zjeq,pineapplecharm,1,t1_cs19hij,cs1zjeq,t3_396yrc,t5_2qh1i,1433957784,cs19hij,"^^Edited ^^to ^^ease ^^any ^^confusion ^^caused ^^by ^^my ^^choices ^^of ^^words.

A short list of things people do that make no sense:  

* Buy a car without a thought to the cost of maintenance. I cannot tell you how many times I've seen this. In fact, it was gonna be lower on the list, but I bumped it to the top because people should see it, even if it's just one guy. When you buy a car, you should really consider how much it costs to maintain the damn thing. I used to change oil for a living and I can't tell you how many people would pull up in a $75,000 Mercedes or BMW then get mad when we told them their oil change was more expensive than an oil change for say, a Chevy Cruze. There's a reason, jackass. A Mercedes doesn't run the same oil weight or quantity that the aforementioned car does.  

* Drive them like morons. Seriously, there's a lot of talk about parts and service, but the absolute **WORST** thing people do to their cars is drive them like morons. Hitting every pot hole in the road, slamming on your brakes, jackrabbit starting^^1 , and racing around everywhere is hard on your car and will cost you a lot of money in the long run.

* Install HID's and do one of two things: Either install them in stock headlight housings (which is illegal and dumb as hell) OR don't point them correctly. HID's are far brighter than standard headlights and you should definitely do your research before you install them.  

* Ride on bald tires. Not even worn tires. Bald tires. Seriously, I've seen people riding on tires so bald you couldn't even tell what the tread pattern **used** to be. Some even had the bands showing.  

* Impatiently attempt to tint their own windows and end up with an army of tiny air pockets all over the back window. It's *really* obvious and you look like an idiot.  

* Buy cheap knockoff wheels because their price is much lower than the more expensive version they cloned. You get what you pay for when you buy wheels. Cheaper aftermarket wheels can be made of crappier materials, resulting in a shattered rim when you hit a pot hole hard enough. Obviously any rim can only take so much abuse, but the quality ones will last a lot longer.  

* Modify their cars then don't have them re-tuned. This is a big one for people who modify their cars. By changing the car's performance, you've nullified the factory tuning because it was done with stock parts in mind. You need to have the car's ECU re-tuned.^^2  

^^1 
&gt; Jackrabbit starting is when the light turns green and someone takes off at a much higher pace than it actually necessary for the flow of traffic. Not anywhere near racing necessarily, but far faster than you would normally start. It's one thing if you're in a hurry, but to do it all the time is terrible. Your car doesn't like that being done to it. It's much better to ease into the throttle and let the car accelerate at a reasonable pace.  

^^2
&gt; Re-tuning the ECU is reserved for more major part changes such as changing the camshaft, heads, fuel injectors (maybe), turbocharging/supercharging, etc. Changing an intake does not apply.

If there's a specific movie, I want to see, especially if it's a new one, then I'm often let down, this is true. This is the most often-heard complaint about Netflix. But knowing this, I just browse if I'm bored, to see if there's anything that seems interesting to watch. For that, Netflix is great, there's always interesting movies and such.

The best part about Netflix though is indeed tv shows. It keeps track of what episodes you've watched, where you've stopped watching, etc.

To use a weird example, if I need to use the bathroom while watching a tv show, I'll pause it and return to the main menu on my computer/tv, grab my tablet, and when I open netflix there, it's ready to resume where I left off. Take the tablet with me into the bathroom (there's a shelf there for reading materials, or tablets), watch the tv show while pooping, afterwards, pause the show on the tablet, hit """"refresh"""" on the tv/computer netflix and resume again.

It seems trivial, but that inter-device keeping track of tv shows is really great.

I do still pirate shows that I can't find elsewhere but when I have a choice, I use Netflix instead of pirating.

Interestingly, I also have HBO, including the HBO Go app/website, but that is such a steaming pile of shit that I still pirate shows like Game of Thrones, even though I can watch them legally through HBO Go. :)

for a final metaphore: switching from piracy to netflix is like getting a car when you're used to riding a bicycle (for context: I'm Dutch). You never *get rid of* the bicycle, it's still there, and for some trips, it's better (like going downtown). But it's just so much easier to just grab the car and if you have both, that's what you'll end up doing most often.

The metaphore doesn't stop there: when you only have a bike, you might go to the hip, new downtown places often. You'll think: well, if I get a car, I'll still go there, but just use the bike like I have. But you don't. Once you have that car and are used to the ease and luxury, you'll find yourself going downtown less often and instead not mind going to other places, that sometimes are a tad uglier and old-fashioned (suburban supermarkets/malls) but are just fine and have free parking. 

That's what Netflix does too. It's so easy to start up a movie that might be one or two years old but still sounds interesting and you haven't seen yet, that you'll find yourself doing that more often than surfing the torrents for the very latest flick.

That said, I did see The Interview a few days before it was digitally released. I still *have* my bicycle, and when something is interesting enough, I don't mind firing it up. :)

Edit: to clarify, I don't *always* poop with my tablet present, but sometimes, when a show is really suspenseful, it's nice that it's possible.",t1_cpug326,TheRufmeisterGeneral,1,t1_cpufnhu,cpug326,t3_30mlai,t5_2t6b3,1427635468

They can carry out more instructions in given clockspeed since they are simpler. However, because they are simpler, that means that you often need multiple instructions to equate a single CISC instruction. That being said, that does allow for more flexibility in optimization, hence where the efficiency claim comes from. For example, x86 will often copy numbers in registers to and from memory automatically before and after an instruction. Its easier to write and saves RAM. Whereas, in ARM, you have to explicitly tell the processor to do this but you don't need to if it isn't necessary, so you save CPU cycles. Anybody that has has done real work with x86/ARM assembly will probably scoff at the huge generalization, but its the gist of it.

Either way, that's why comparing clockspeed is a poor choice in RISC vs CISC. They are entirely different design philosophies and each have their own strengths. ",,Demache,1,t1_ddecvuy,ddg982s,t3_5s69pd,t5_2txls,1486490918

5081,"I was once leaving a real ale beer festival after a long afternoon drinking things with names like """"Dr Gutrot's Stygian Stench Stout"""".  Happily refreshed, my forward planning was not at its peak as I crowded into an underground train along with the thronging masses of tipsy brew enthusiasts, and it did not occur to me to effect a tactical evacuation of the nascent gas bubble forming in my nether regions before embarking.

Three stops in and the enormity of my mistake became apparent. The growling in my pipework was getting harder to ignore and the pressure at the gates was mounting with every jolt.  I faced a vexing dilemma: I wanted desperately to hold on until my destination but with four stops to go and an appreciable increase in stress with every passing moment I knew this was not without risk.  I toyed with the idea of a one-cheek puff which might relieve enough pressure to enable me to survive the journey but that would require the kind of sphincter control normally associated with a flautist's lips and not the ravaged, spent bunghole that thirty years of curry and Guinness had won me.

Reader, I gambled.  I knew I could do it.  I'm not a child; I know all the tricks.  I clenched and I moved about.  I leaned against the wall.  I sat awkwardly on that little bench thing by the door, one cheek squeezed up against the other, so my entire upper body weight was employed in a pressure retention operation that would have impressed the guys that put up the Hoover Dam.  Two stops went by.  Three.  Then a jolt pulling out of the fourth nearly dislodged me from my seat.  I managed to hold on but definitely felt the tiniest mosquito's cough sneak out between my terrified cheeks.

I tried to quell the panic and gripped the bars, bracing to see if it stank enough for the thronged crowds to notice.  There was nothing.  Briefly.  Then Mr Hankey's gay flatmate burst in, viciously stuck his erect shit-cock up my nose and flooded my sinuses with bum gas.  Dear God.  For so much of my life I'd been under the blissful impression that one's own effluent was less offensive than others' and yet this, this tiny forward scout of the massed army assembling in what felt like the entire length of my poor gut, was so pungent, so powerful, so downright radioactive that every hair in my nostrils stood on end, saluted and died instantly.  I choked back vomit as my eyes flooded with tears and, before I could take control of my muscles, reflexively opened my mouth.  This was the tipping point.

Smelling a fart is one thing.  To taste it, dear reader, is to see God in all His wrath.  Millennia of evolution had tried its hardest to punish my ancestors into avoiding getting even one molecule of excrement into the front end of my digestive system and now my brain was flooded with signals that I had just bitten into a double-strength Mississippi shit cake.  It was too much, and in all the excitement my ringpiece gave up the ghost.

Have you ever been to the zoo?  Have you heard the angry, glottal roar of an injured lion, echoing into a concrete pen?  Imagine such a sound but played in reverse.  There was no initial explosion, but rather a soft growl that grew in waves as a feedback system meant the increasing foulness of the stench flowing to my face brought me closer to a catastrophic failure of arse-seal.  For five long seconds the trumpeting of an approaching horde of randy elephants built and echoed through the carriage, causing those nearest me to turn in amusement.

""""Sew a button on that,"""" cried one wag.

Another: """"Speak up, Brown; you're through!""""

""""One more turn and she would've started!""""

""""A confident appeal by the Austral..."""" the fourth was cut short.

It is an oft-quoted """"fact"""" that placing a frog in cold water and slowly bringing it to the boil can cause the hapless amphibian not to notice it is being cooked alive.  No such luck for those on the 23:24 from Earls Court that fateful Summer evening.  The white heat of the offensive hit them suddenly and irreversibly, fogging up glasses and bleaching delicate fabrics as it flooded through the enclosed space like a fire through a 1970s variety club dressing room.  Witticisms were replaced by gutteral exclamations. """"Gas, boys; Gas!"""" cried one as he floundered for the other end of the carriage, clawing at the other passengers in a vain attempt to escape Turd Zero.  But even those who did break from the door-bound throng suffered a cruel irony - their very movement agitated the smell and brought it with them, poisoning the very fresh air they sought to reach.

As the panic reached its peak, the train slowed and, through the tears in my stinging eyes, I perceived the doors spring open.  I launched myself out of the train, certain that the grasping hands were my fellow travellers effecting an attempted arrest as a precursor to exacting a terrible revenge on the poisoner of their journey.

But as I staggered out into the fresh night air, no such retribution came.  I turned and looked at the carnage inside, the torn newspapers and trodden-on hats, the glasses all askew and the woman dry retching into her handbag.  And it hit me - *they were so preoccupied with survival they didn't know who the culprit was*.

I paused, blood rushing back to my face, and smoothed down the front of my shirt.  The doors were beeping shrilly, faint wafts of my epic trouser disaster puffing clouds against the clear night sky.

&gt;The cycling culture there is pretty awful and getting worse as it gets more popular. Everybody is Very Important And In A Hurry, and too many of them think they're in an alleycat race, Cat 6-ing it all day errday. The pace is extremely fast compared to most other European cities, and it's very macho and every-man-for-himself, partly because the awful traffic and crap infrastructure mean it's no place for your granny on her shopping bike. 

I miss popping out to the shops / to meet friends on my ancient shit bike with a basket. When I lived in Oxford you could cycle anywhere wearing anything and everyone seemed to get along fine.

5172,"&gt; Google wouldn't be liable for the emotional damage

I feel like the whole point of OP's post is that it's the *guilt* rather than the actual financial liability that's bothering them.

It all comes down to practicality; what's worth fixing and what *can* be fixed, and the difference between one's own paranoia and the pragmatism of others is often stark.

I once misplaced a decimal on a set of alloy wheels, marking them down from £740 to £74 per set of four.  The first I knew about it was when £10,000 worth of them had been ordered overnight.  Legally, in the UK, if you've accepted money you have to deliver the goods and I shat a brick, convinced I'd be liable for a hundred grand's shortfall in revenue.

God bless the guy at the warehouse who painstakingly called each customer and told them the only fitment we had left was Renault 2CV ([three hub bolts](http://www.2cvcity.co.uk/new-road-wheel-15-inch-painted.html), who knew?) and """"generously"""" gave them all full refunds.  We pre-authorised after that, and had to manually approve each order before we took the money.",,pineapplecharm,1,t1_dhn3t8o,dhn78ge,t3_6bheco,t5_2qs0q,1494965815,dhn3t8o,"&gt; Conversely, imagine if Google maps, a free service, sent you 200 miles off course and made you miss a funeral.

Well, at least in that case, Google wouldn't be liable for the emotional damage. But this is the idea. I've worked on a few projects where there was quite a bit of potentially irreversible damage - we handled emotionally valuable data, and losing or mutilating that data would have been much worse than billing someone for $5 and having to issue a refund.

Another example from my own experience is from a car rental firm, where a colleague implemented a new system for importing traffic fines electronically, automatically matching them to customers, and billing them accordingly; he fucked up a little, we didn't notice until 3 months later, when the overdue notices started coming, and we ended up having to write off €30,000 worth of traffic fines we no longer had the data to match them to the offending customers.

And on the other side of things; I worked on a custom-built web shop once that was a nightmare of a legacy mess, and it had billing bugs that we knew about, but couldn't fix because the fix would have required changing the entire application architecture, data model, code, everything, and that would have introduced a hundred more bugs. However, the web shop operated in a line of business with insane profit margins; they'd routinely hand out 30% discounts and still make a profit. Meaning that these bugs, which caused something like 1% of orders to be shipped but never billed, were considered perfectly acceptable; the bugs that caused orders to be billed twice were considered even less of a problem, because either the customer would notice, and you'd give them a refund (which was about 30 seconds work), or they wouldn't, and you'd happily cash in twice. What did make me nervous on that project however was the fact that there were no backups, and a single rogue `DELETE` query could have killed the company overnight.",,tdammers,2,t1_dhn0kfj,dhn3t8o,t3_6bheco,t5_2qs0q,1494962101

5185,"Argentina and the UK had actually (at the behest of the UN) been discussing at very least co-governance, if not transfer to Argentina entirely, since the sixties.  The islanders, however, weren't keen and the UK government was loathe to treat its own citizens, however barren and far away their home, so poorly as to give away their land from under them.

Argentina, pissed off at the lack of progress, fancied the islands back.  They knew the islands didn't have much going on by way of defences and, while you're right and they knew the UK wouldn't be a pushover in person, they also knew that actually showing up to the party was going to be a massive ballache for the Brits and gambled that they wouldn't bother.

Of course, Thatcher grasped the opportunity to be a war Prime Minister with both hands.  The Argentine army had the opportunity at that point to withdraw but I am guessing they figured they had the advantage of being there first, a good stock of fast attack jets all ready to go, and of course the lethal, ship-sinking Exocet missiles from France.

However, even these advantages were eroded by (a) the longest bombing run in history at that point, involving planes to refuel planes to refuel the bombers (seriously, look it up - it was insane) which damaged the runway too much for the jets to take off and (b) one of the sneakiest bits of espionage outside of a James Bond film, where Mi5 tied up all the Exocets they could find in bogus deals which never went through, but kept the missiles from being sold to Argentina.

Once the actual soldiers showed up the conscript Argentine soldiers had already had enough.  History, being written by the winners, does not give a clear picture of whether the Belgrano was actually retreating, and it's entirely possible that the British forces had travelled too far, and staged too impressive a Vulcan attack, simply to shake hands and go home again.

We could end up having to say yes.

- fish. The fish are caught by mainly British crews then processed by staff who are almost entirely East European. Those people may be gone in 2019 and good luck getting school leavers to gut fish. The catch is mostly sold to Europe and may become uncompetitive when tariffs are priced in. The whole industry is heavily subsidised and that may go. If we don't agree a deal we may see a fish war with both sides overfishing the stock so the others don't get them. So many delicate parts any one of which could destroy the industry.

- Immigration control. Overall immigrants add GDP, this is a net loss, possibly a big one. Controlling immigrants will make most of us poorer.

- Global trade deals. We already had trade all over the globe. We will actually come out of many of our existing trade deals because they were agreed with the whole EU. The notion that we're going to get better deals is at best a guess. We may well get worse deals with places like India as a result of having to negotiate a new deal and them wanting free movement which I'm sure we'll see as a red line.",,Callduron,130,t1_dkowb9f,dkox1it,t3_6pfglz,t5_2qhqb,1500984836

&gt; I don't think he was far enough in front for the driver to see him

Yes, we are in agreement.  I was just picking up on your previous comment saying

&gt; Not sure how you can miss the danger

because I can totally see how """"I'm in front"""" can subconsciously be equivalent to """"I'm safe"""" if you don't realise that it doesn't necessarily mean the driver behind can see you.

We all undertake stationary traffic all day long and, while some may briefly overtake again when the light goes green, there's no question of hanging back behind every vehicle, particuarly when stopped. A left indicating bus, when you don't know how long you have to get through? Obviously a bad move.  But in this case, the truck is heading straight on, there's loads of room in the left turn lane... I can totally empathise.

Doesn't make the cyclist in the right, I just don't think he was quite as unreasonable as his adrenaline-fuelled, post-near-death experience screaming might suggest.

I agree with that. Happened to me before and scared the shit out of me.

&gt; So where's the line between that, and what happened here?

I think that this situation is much more similar to undertaking than the one you are describing. The cyclist may have briefly been in front of the lorry when setting off but I don't think he was far enough in front for the driver to see him, let alone say the driver overtook him and then cut him off.

I think we're not disagreeing here. My point really was that there is so much about dangers of HGVs and their blind spots in the media and signs at the back of the lorries (although, admittedly this one didn't have one) that, even if you're an inexperience cyclists, the risks were very obvious.

Jerky movements, near random braking, stopping too hard in traffic etc. By looking as far ahead as you can you see the cars reacting to whatever is in the highway way before you get there so you have time to think and react.

I've seen this event several times and everything is negative.  The main group are ostentatious and rude, the stragglers actively aggressive.  There seems to be a sense that because *they* are on eco-friendly bikes and *everyone else* is in evil nasty cars (which of course conveniently omits pedestrians, people trying to get home on buses etc) puts the CM on some unassailable moral high ground, but actually by riding so roughshod over the road laws they're proving the exact opposite. The cynical use of a disproportionate number of girls as the 'corks', presumably because people are less likely to get out of their cars and fucking deck them, doesn't go unnoticed either.  They're all just spineless, obnoxious twats hiding behind numbers and I make zero apology for calling them that.

Incidentally I didn't say I take no responsibility for my words, I said I wasn't the one to introduce unnececssary toxicity.  It's the instigators of CM that take no responsibility; if they had any balls they'd set up a legal framework along the lines of """"let's follow the rules of the fucking road instead of endangering everyone"""" and make it a force for good rather than a disgusting rally of selfish nonsense that just makes everyone hate cyclists a little bit more.",,pineapplecharm,2,t1_dq8r7uu,dq8s7l7,t3_7e9zku,t5_2wcdj,1511460454,dq8r7uu,I think you need to wind it in a fair bit.

Yes, there are forced marriages. I'm not claiming that there aren't. I'm saying that the Western idea is wrong that an """"arranged marriage"""" is necessarily a forced marriage.  
  
For non-forced arranged marriages (which is a lot of them) it's more like, the parents and families act like a kind of dating app. They bring together various people who they think would be suited, and then the prospective bride and groom make a decision.  
  
The thing about this process is that conversations can get serious quickly. You don't have to wait for 20 dates before asking about kids, for example, or sharing money. You KNOW you're looking for a spouse, so you can get to those details right away.  
  
This man (or woman) would like to start a family right away. This man (or woman) wouldn't. This guy would prefer a wife who stays home. This guy would expect you to have a job.

One of them gets cancer - The long term healthcare costs, treatment, drugs all covered by the NHS. All in patient care covered by general taxation. Getting cancer is just bad luck, so we should all shoulder the burden of the costs of it as a common good for society.

Say now that same person got dementia instead; The long term healthcare costs would be deducted from the estate value instead, some drug costs are covered by the NHS, but most of the social care isn't. 

Say that person after 10 years of cancer or dementia then dies.

If they had cancer, the surviving spouse can remain in the same house, and maybe sell it to fund their own care by downsizing to somewhere smaller. They can then pass on this estate to any surviving children.

If they had dementia, the surviving spouse will only have £100,000 left from the estate because the care costs have swallowed the rest of the house value. The house has to be sold to recover the costs of the social care. Because of their age, they can no longer get a mortgage so remaining in the house is off the cards.

&gt; The concept of the alpha wolf is well ingrained in the popular wolf literature at least partly because of my book """"The Wolf: Ecology and Behavior of an Endangered Species,"""" written in 1968, published in 1970, republished in paperback in 1981, and currently still in print, despite my numerous pleas to the publisher to stop publishing it.

&gt;One of the outdated pieces of information is the concept of the alpha wolf. """"Alpha"""" implies competing with others and becoming top dog by winning a contest or battle. However, most wolves who lead packs achieved their position simply by mating and producing pups, which then became their pack. In other words they are merely breeders, or parents, and that's all we call them today, the """"breeding male,"""" """"breeding female,"""" or """"male parent,"""" """"female parent,"""" or the """"adult male"""" or """"adult female.""""

One thing I made the mistake of was asking too many technical questions in the first one I did. Technical questions don't really let you know anything about a candidate imo. 


Now I just have a sample list of several generic questions -around a particular pattern the candidate likes, or asking them to explain the benefit of a certain pattern. 
The more important part is getting them to talk about what they are working on at the moment, any problems they have had and getting to know them as a person.

Ask about:

* What are you working on at the moment. Use this to follow up on the technology they use, what made them choose library X, what was their role in the team

* How they deal with conflict. I find this one vital . You don't want someone too scared to raise things, you also don't want a loose cannon. How do they escalate issues? Do they take ownership of issues, etc.

* What their least favorite part of the job is, what is their least favorite language or library. Follow up with asking why, alternatives  they consider better etc


Problem is some people can just retain technical information, or be bullshitters. Getting them to talk about their projects means you can touch on the technology they use, as well as attained what sort of person they are and what relationship they have with their current collegues. We have rejected some really intelligent guys based on this who we later found out (through mutual friends) was arrogant and had a problem with authority.


It took me several interviews to perfect this and I am still improving, but we haven't hired a bad person in a long time since we stopped making it purely tech focussed.


The way we see it is that we would rather have the right person, and you can always provide more training or get rid of them if they blatently lied. It's harder to get someone to change their attitude.

We're not seeing the """"death of the living room"""" at all.

A specific subset of individuals that are either poor or at the beginning of their careers in a highly in demand city are choosing a smaller space because they'd rather treat their house as a place to sleep and enjoy life otherwise.

It's always been the case that having a """"living room"""" is implicitly spending 25-50% more rent (depending on number of residents sharing house/flat). How could it ever be otherwise?

Regulation forcing certain rooms to not be used as bedrooms just pushes up prices across the board because you've reduced supply. We get this posted on here all the time when people moan about 10 people living in a house or whatever. OK, so you evict them - what happens next? The choices are homelessness, moving out of the city, and taking up more space.

I borrow £10 from you.

I borrow £10 from Steve.

I borrow £10 from Shirley.

I'm repaying you all back at a rate of £1 a week, so as long as I have £3 a week to spend on repaying you all, everything is fine.

Now imagine that for some reason you want me to repay you early, after only three weeks.  I still owe each of you £7 but I don't have an income stream, and I spent £9 on a """"Shitposter General"""" branded hat so let's say I only have £12 to my name.

If you get nervous that I'm never going to make any money and decide you just want what you can get, you can sue for me to go bankrupt and have my assets divided among everyone to whom I owe money.  So you, Steve and Shirley would get £4 each.  But maybe Steve and Shirley don't want the money right now.  They believe that if they wait long enough they'll get their full £10 back.  So nobody makes me bankrupt because even though it might suit them, it would screw over everyone else.

Now what happens if the reason you want early repayment is because you're struggling to make payments on your own loan from Janet?  If Janet makes *you* bankrupt, your loan to me is an asset which now needs to be liquidated to make payment to Janet.  But Janet, now, would be screwing over Steve and Shirley even though they have nothing to do with her.

The situation is now that nobody in the chain can go bust without massive wider consequences.  I don't really have to make payments on my loans because I can just whine to my creditors that they'll damage society at large if they wind me up, and I will *totally* pay them eventually, just not right now.

5660,"Retail is funny.  On the one hand, 5% sounds like very little to the untrained ear. On the other hand, 5% of a £240,000 house sale is good money even if you make nothing for weeks beforehand.  Likewise, £4 doesn't sound like a lot, and 5% of £4 is only 20p, but on the other if you literally have a queue all day and are taking £4 every thirty seconds that's nearly twenty five quid an hour.

Until you get there you just don't know how much business you're going to do, and hence how well you will be paid.  The percentage, and the individual item value, aren't enough information to ascertain this.  So yeah, in a small way you're justified in your paranoia that people might twig that you're not the most experienced sales agent in London.  That said, a """"queue all day"""" is extremely unlikely, and for every hour that's busy, you're sandbagging against the quiet hours, 11am on a Tuesday for example, when nobody's doing anything, and those times will drain your average earnings relentlessly.

One thing of which you can be certain is that the kind of people who make money employing people to sell dirt-cheap fried snacks to tourists for £4 a pop aren't doing so because they are enlightened employers.  They do know how busy it will be, and they are offering the absolute bare minimum required to make sure their stall is staffed.  Whatever the numbers, you almost certainly will not get rich selling churros at Winter Wonderland, pretty much by definition.  In a way I'd be *more* suspicious if they were offering 20%.

Minimum wage, however, is just that: a minimum.  If they offer you minimum wage OTE, that's not legal.  I do a few retail events where we pay minimum plus 10% commission, usually around a hundred a day extra, but that minimum is absolutely above minimum wage.

Yeah mine is Verifone which charges about 3.95%

What happened is last year TfL increased the starting meter price from £2.40 to £2.60 and this was supposed to cover the cost of the card commission. Bit of a strange choice because it meant that customers were effectively paying a card surcharge even if they chose to pay by cash, but whatever. It's not a make or break situation and i'm just happy to provide the card facility to passengers as long as the commission is reasonable.

&gt; How common is it for cabbies to own their cabs vs rent them?

Really not sure on the statistics to be honest but i'd imagine it's fairly even. The running costs actually work out not that different when comparing owning vs renting.

The new electric taxis will cost something in the region of £55,000

&gt; Why do some cabbies have 15 year old cabs still on the road?

15 years is the maximum age limit for a cab to be used for work. Once a cab exceeds 15 years you can still use it for driving about/leisure but not for work.

I THINK there might be some kind of exemption whereby you can get an engine upgrade or something to show that the emissions output has been improved but I really don't know so don't quote me on that!

&gt; Can you tell us what % of your rides are paid for by card vs cash?

Every day it varies quite a lot. I have some days where it can be 90% cash and others 90% card so it's difficult to say, but on the whole cash probably makes up about 30-40% total. The remaining 60-70% on card is actually mostly through mytaxi and Gett. Those apps make up about 40-50% of my work and most jobs are paid by card (on an account through the app). The remaining card work just comes from passengers off the street or station ranks were most passengers still prefer paying by cash.

&gt; What is your favourite lunch/snack spot?

Oh man that would be telling!

Sometimes on a busy night i'll park up in the outer circle of regents park and just catch my breath for a bit. It's really close to the west end so super easy to get to. At night there's a really quiet and calm ambience there so just makes a change from all the frantic noise, lights and traffic. You can easily do 6 hours in the cab without realizing and then it catches up with you so it's very important to get a good break now and then.

One of the best things about the job is just never knowing where you're going to end up. A couple weeks back I had a job down to Catford, it was a lovely sunny day so I just decided to lie down in the middle of Dulwich park for a few hours.

Favourite snack spot of our customers strangely seems to be the Chelsea Tea Hut at the south side of Chelsea Bridge. For some reason the wealthy young arabs of knightsbridge can't seem to get enough of it! I mean it's literally just a tea hut doing burgers but whatever. Probably due to just being open 24/7

&gt; Nicest celeb you’ve picked up?

Frankie Dettori! An absolute legend and really nice guy, Arsenal fan too.

&gt; Strangest passenger?

Too many to mention but here's a few off the top of my head:

Russian guy on the Crystal Palace one way system. Had an """"al pacino in taxi driver"""" mohawk-style haircut and was wearing some kind of military gear. The dude was completely off his face, spent the whole journey yelling at me to go faster because the police were coming, it was 4am in the suburbs of south london and there were no cars around.

One guy got in off Edgware Road and instead of telling me where he wanted to go just barked seemingly random directions at me every 5 seconds """"left!"""" """"right!"""" """"straight!"""" etc. We actually went in a circle at one point. He offered no explanation and got out 10 minutes later just a short walk from where I originally picked him up.

A young spoiled brat in the kensington and chelsea area screaming down the phone to her parents because she didn't get enough allowance money to pay for an expensive knightsbridge restaurant so had to walk out without paying the bill. You really see the wealth inequality of London warts and all doing this job.

Driving extremely unsavoury characters around the backstreets of Harlesden at about 4am had me very on edge. At that time of the night people can switch easily so you've got to gauge their temperament well and try to keep them on your side.

Saudi chap asked me to park and wait on Edgware Road late at night while he got his shopping. Then stood around on the pavement for half an hour with the meter running, smoking and talking to me about life in England. Asked me if I could take him and his wife to either Liverpool, Cambridge, Stonehenge or Amsterdam the next day (he couldn't make his mind up which one lol). I gave him my number and said to give me a call but it never happened.

Interestingly I find you actually get a lot more trouble and bad behaviour from the more wealthier/professional/white collar types when they've had a bit too much to drink (it's usually the blokes). They let themselves go a bit too much, whereas working class and ethnic minority Londoners are usually always impeccably behaved and polite on a night out.

&gt; What do you think about the new electric cabs being marketed as the future?

I think it's fantastic, just like the credit card thing though, it should have happened years ago. Still better late then never. Admittedly I am anxious to find out more about the running costs, battery etc but it's for the best. I suffer from mild asthma so I really have no interest in breathing diesel fumes like this for the rest of my life. What concerns me though is the lack of infrastructure in place for them. They're going on the road later this year and I haven't seen any charging points. I don't have a driveway and don't live on the ground floor so in theory i'm going to have to run a plug extension cable out of my window down to the ground floor and charge up my cab, it doesn't really make sense.",,Cabologist,47,t1_dnd6x3c,dne6m4t,t3_71smpc,t5_2qkog,1506165038

The British style is more prosaic, meaning we like to sound credible and educated by referencing well-known literary phrases or using slightly unusual words that carry the precise connotations we wish to convey.  The idea is to communicate subtly that we've thought about the matter deeply and chosen a precise word.

The German attitude is to take the first word that means what you want to say, and use it.  The enthusiasm for portmanteau bolted-together nouns comes from a similar place; why invent a new word for """"seal"""" when *seehund* (literally """"sea-dog"""") says what you need?

""""The British government seems to enjoy empty discussion as much as it lacks strategic focus"""" would have been something I'd expect to read in *The Economist* but """"lacks a clear concept despite talking a lot"""" sounds more like an ADHD child's school report.

Advisories are being replaced with minor fails. You will still get a pass but they will be noted on your test certificate. These are pre written and approved by the DVSA.

Those of you who have changed your standard headlight bulbs for HID's will now get a major fail even if the aim is correct. It has always been an offence to fit HID bulbs to halogen headlamps so the MOT is now in line with that.

Reverse lights are now part of the MOT for any car registered from 1st September 2009 (59 plate onwards). Daytime running lamps (DRL's) &amp; front fog lamps must work on vehicles registered from March 2018 (18 plate onwards).

Engine Management Light is now a major fail. It must come on with the ignition and then turn off when the engine is started.

Brake pad warning lights are a major fail.

Handbrake with excessive travel is now a major fail. Before it would only a fail if there was no reverse travel.

Contaminated (dirty) brake fluid is a major fail.

Oil leaks (engine, gearbox etc) can be a major fail.

A vehicle fitted with a DPF that emits any kind of visible smoke during the metered test will now fail.

Emissions limits for diesels registered on or after 1st of January 2014 have been reduced. All diesels will now need to pass the limit that was set by the manufacturer when the car was new. This can be found on the VIN plate. For example the current limit for your diesel car may be 1.50. That could change to as low as 0.30 with the new rules.

5759,"A distant relative of mine was a Holocaust escapee who settled in Johannesburg. He ran a successful manufacturing business until he retired in the 1980s.  Within a year or two he got bored, so he set up a new business in Soweto - the largely very deprived township outside the white city limits - which exclusively employed learning-impaired locals to make simple toys and gadgets, and ran as a nonprofit.

Anyway, one night this old guy and his wife got carjacked outside a restaurant.  The one crime the cops did have time for over there was murder so the jackers tended to leave you alone if you just handed over the keys, and the elderly couple made it home safely.  In the morning, he took a cab to the factory.

One of the local guys, a shady gangster-looking chap in ripped jeans and jewellery, was dropping off his brother.  He noticed the cab and asked what happened.  """"Remind me,"""" he said.  """"What's your number plate again?""""

5767,"I was 24 and on the bones of my arse when a mate invited me to go to the Ascot races with him.  I literally couldn't split the cab fare to get there, that's how skint I was, but it was a work jolly to impress some young execs (he actually ended up dating one of them for a while) and he was happy to comp me a few drinks in exchange for some banter.

What surprised me was the way the employees from the other company were betting.  They were not big earning guys and they were slapping £20, £50 bets down like it was nothing.  One of them was a couple of hundred down within an hour or two.  Forced by penury not to partake, I just spent time chatting to some of the girls and, perhaps because I didn't have my nose in the odds book, one of them and I hit it off.

She wanted to put a bet on and, as flirtatious women do, she wanted me to hold her hand while she did it.  Once we were at the window, of course, it felt gauche not to do the same so I picked a horse in a rush just for its name - """"Mr Aviator"""" to match my sunglasses - and put on £5 """"each way"""", because that left me another £5 to get home and there's less chance of losing because you get reduced odds for a 2nd or 3rd place finish.  Unfortunately, I didn't know that """"£5 each way"""" means £5 to win and £5 for the other two places.  Even through the booze I was gripped with horror as I realised that would completely clean me out for the day.  Still, I wanted to get laid so I coughed up my train fare and we rejoined the group.

Now it must be said that the guys who'd been betting all afternoon had been taking plenty of opportunity to crow about how much they knew about betting, and 'the form', and the state of the ground, etc, and if I've ever been mansplained to it was by these twats, who were taking every opportunity to tell me what slips, and odds, and """"expected gain"""" meant.  I think the bravado had taken on a life of its own and they'd all over-spent on the afternoon trying to impress each other, and me, and while I have to admit I was surprised by the lack of success I certainly felt they deserved it for being dicks.  However, as they'd started to run out of money their attention was wandering from the racetrack and as I returned with the young lady I found one of them very brashly elbowing his way into the conversation.  My first instinct was to try and repel him but, I won't lie, I was kind of hoping I could nudge him into offering her a drink, which would buy me another half an hour or so before I had to come up with a sudden excuse to leave because I literally couldn't afford a glass of cheap Chardonnay at that point.

I stood there and tried to bat him off just enough without bringing things to a head, when in the background I heard it.

""""Mr Aviator challenging on the outside...""""

I looked down at my ticket.  It said 33-1.  I looked down the raceway and, sure enough, the fucker was right on the inside, poking up next to the race leader with his jockey low down and strangely still.  It was like the pivotal scene in an eighties movie as the gambler smarmed up to the girl in front of me while, over his shoulder, the pack came thundering down towards us.

That glorious equine bastard crossed the line first by barely a head.  I have never heard such a sound as that tannoy - """"and it's Mr Aviator, Mr Aviator followed by-"""" by """"who gives a shit"""", and """"I am off to the bar"""" in third.

""""Sorry mate,"""" I said to the gambler, literally interrupting him by sticking my bet slip right in his smug face. """"Was this the *winner* in that race?""""  I showed it to another guy who had also been a rude cock.  """"Is 33-1 good odds then?  Did I win something?""""  Their faces were a torment of envious hatred.  Fuck, it was delicious.

I left, with the girl, and went to pick up the winnings: £230.  On a whim, I went upstairs and bought two bottles of champagne on ice at £60 each.  Screw it, easy come, easy go.  And watching those fucks take my wine and thank me for it was worth twenty times what I paid.

It could have been an absolute classic case of a toxic early win but, somehow, every time I thought of that day I would remember those other guys, with their empty posturing and drained wallets.  I got the girl's number but she cancelled our first date and we never met again.

I feel that was a good analogy.",,pineapplecharm,7,t1_drg5zp2,drhivek,t3_7kp0kq,t5_3j2jr,1513713573,drg5zp2,"On a perfect 50/50 odds, a Martingale strategy is fine (you'll break even over time on average)...

Of course red/black isn't 50:50 but 18/37:18/37:1/37 with green in the mix taking a steady ~4% of each pound.

This is why casinos spend a fortune to operate honestly - they don't need crooked tables or rigged bandits, it's all right there in the maths.  Rig a game and people will stop playing, or worse they'll spot the pattern and bet with the house and the game won't be played.  Better to keep it honest and celebrate a big winner - as they'll spend it all right back with you anyway, and that kick of adrenaline from a win is a genuinely engineered state from the brain's reward centres buttons being pushed.

5784,"Nice work getting the refund.  To be honest when I heard:

&gt; Mazda RX-7 (with a rotary engine..) ... and some of the seals looked a but dubious

I thought the story was going in a different direction entirely!

I too lost half a tank of fuel to a new purchase, a Lotus Elan (the plastic 90s one) which had developed a crack in the (also plastic) tank just below the filler pipe.  The previous owner having never had more than 1/4 tank in there (he'd put 100 miles on it in four years according to the MOT record) I believe he just didn't know, but that was an expensive discovery too.

The funny part was finding a company who would take on the repair job.  """"25 year-old?  Plastic?  *Fuel tank??*  Jog on mate!"""" was the response from three different companies, until I found a thermoplastics outfit in Maidenhead.  They also said no at first but by pure dumb luck the now-retired original owner was within earshot.  """"I'll do it,"""" he said.  """"No receipt, no guarantee, but I'll do it.""""  He sat right down with, basically, the pro version of a hot glue gun, and welded the fucker shut in about five minutes flat.  What a legend.  It's been just fine for four years now!",,pineapplecharm,1,t1_dstasnm,dstegeg,t3_7qzp8j,t5_3j2jr,1516199827,dstasnm,"Oooh mild story time..

When I was about.. 19 or so, I was looking to replace my 1982 Hyundai S-coupe. So, with my monthly pay packet I went and bought a used Porsche 928.

I managed to get my insurance company to switch my insurance at no extra cost for the last month of it and though I'd arrived. Now granted it was old, a bit battered and all the rest of it, but it was a Porsche and it was mechanically sound...  Sadly, my insurer decided that on renewal, the premium would have to increase rather a lot more than I could afford (funny that). 

So I stuck it in storage hoping to sell it and pick up something else. Turns out storage is pretty expensive too, so after about 6 months of not being able to find a buyer, I offered it to the storage company in lieu of payment.  No more Porsche for me.

I didn't let that put me off though, this time I spent a bit of time with the autotrader (paper version at the time..) looking to see what nippy and smart looking used car I could afford.  I continued with my flash, but old, approach since it seemed to offer the best bang for buck..

So wind forward a month or so, and I managed to find a Mazda RX-7 (with a rotary engine..) for sale in Warrington *and* an insurer who would cover me for less than half my monthly income.  So I got a mate to give me a lift down, got to the garage, looked the car over and it was in pretty decent condition. It sounded nice, IIRC the electrics were a bit knackered and some of the  seals looked a but dubious, and there was  a bit of rust, but it had been freshly MOT'd and, well, I liked the look of it and it went fast so..

I handed over my cash and we both got in for the drive back west.  Happily I decided to fill up the car in Warrington rather than later, so I pulled into a petrol station about 2 minutes from the garage, filled up, walked in to pay.  

When I came out, there was a puddle under the car, not a small puddle, but basically the whole care was sitting on a massive pool of petrol.  Looking under the car, there was fuel literally pissing from around the fuel tank.  Now it hadn't been doing that before so I was a tad confused.

The petrol station staff were obviously a bit pissed off with me at that point, the car had stopped leaving, but there were about 30l of petrol covering the petrol station forecourt at that point..  I'm obviously also pissed off, although at the guy who had just sold me the car.  So I grab my mate out, we push the car clear of the petrol and drive back to the garage, which has cunningly now closed. Except the guy is still in the little shack..

Long story short, I have a bit of a row with the guy about him taking the piss selling a car he knew to be knackered and he spends a lot of time saying I should have checked first.. After about 10 minutes of that (and him suggesting he could fix the perforated fuel tank - because obviously he knew the issue existed... for about the price of the car) we managed to get him to hand back all the cash and take back the car.

Which left me out one tank of petrol, and obviously two sodding train tickets to get home.

You can't just deform it however you like, it won't lie flat while deflated so calculating the area of a circle is not helpful.

Here's the right math:

If you take a sphere of unknown radius R, and you pull on either end of it, it will start to elongate into a sort of straightened banana. The length you will reach is a half-circle of radius R, and we are assuming this is 12'. A full circle has circumference 2πR, so a half circle has length πR. Which gives us the equation:

    πR = 12'

But if it's your first time in London, have you considered taking your time and going around the city to see the sights at your own pace? You won't see much of London outside London.

Try taking the Piccadilly line to Hyde Park Corner. Then hire one of the Santander Cycles public hire bikes from the red stands - you can do this with an app on your phone, you just need a credit card. It costs £2 for a day's access, and £2 for every 30 minutes you have a bike out at a time (the first 30 minutes is free.)

You can then go east and west along our brand new Cycle Superhighway. It goes through Hyde Park, past Buckingham Palace (this little bit isn't quite finished yet, but it's not too bad), and then past Big Ben, the London Eye, the Shard, and the Tower of London. If you keep going east it'll take you towards the East End and the big towers of Canary Wharf.

You can also try exploring the canals and parks. These can be quite narrow and busy with pedestrians, but it should be OK during autumn and winter - just ride slowly and use your bell, and you'll be fine. I recommend the Regent's Canal towpath, Victoria Park, and the new Olympic Park in Stratford. All of these are inside the cycle hire area. Victoria Park is especially beautiful.

It needn't be as exaggerated as that.  The problem is that you're competing with cars that do have lights.  If you're following a car in the dark with no lights, even on a reasonably lit street you can be completely invisible until you happen to drift between the tail lights and my eyes.  Speed, weather and texting will make it worse but they are by no means the cause.

On the one hand, I think that 18 months for manslaughter is not enough - be it with a motorised vehicle, a push bike as was the case here or for example due to shoddy construction, a particularly unfortunate punch to the head in an alcohol fueled confrontation.

On the other hand, it's going to ruin his life for a couple of years - firstly wasted time in jail, then the difficulty of getting a job until he no longer has to declare the conviction when applying.

Personally I think jail time is warranted in this instance; he didn't have a brake; the bicycle therefore wasn't road-legal.  I also think he gives cycling a bad name when it's working hard to overcome its stigma and get more motorists to appreciate the needs of cyclists particularly in our busy cities.

On a side note away from the conviction though, there are many other cyclists that do cycling no favours.  There are plenty of them on the CS2 who ignore traffic lights completely (I note the Met had a day out about half a year ago where they ticketed dozens of them).  I have no doubt the same applies on all other CS routes in London.  Others wear no high visibility gear.  Still others either have pitiful £10 lights from Halfords (so useless they arguably should be banned from sale) or else simply don't bother at all.  You might be able to see well without lights going past Waterloo on a bicycle, bit different when you're a highly distracted motorist in the wet and dark negotiating randomly moving traffic and lots of lane turns and traffic lights.  

Both sides of the argument need to help each other and much more work needs to be done to bring them further into harmony.  Maybe closing down some of the smaller cross-city roads entirely into bicycle only routes might help to ease the problem but it certainly won't solve what is a complex argument -

There's an odd moment of almost paternal concern when the guy says, """"people are crossing the road staring at their phone - that's not normal"""".

Most of these guys are targeting low-hanging fruit, not mindlessly spreading violence and destruction and profiting on the side.  There was good defensive info in here for those willing to see past just feeling indignant about the criminality.

Taking steps to defend yourself isn't victim-blaming either.  Of course these guys *shouldn't* do what they do.

You're right.  Write a letter of complaint to my old tutor immediately!

We all know that this research will be cited by people who haven't read the whole thing, and that it will be reported upon in the press missing details not obvious from a quick scan.  The article linked is unusual in that it picked up on this huge factor, and even then it was only mentioned in passing as an argument that the research was *more* reliable because it had no gender effect.  (I would have said, """"no inter-gender effect"""" but what do I know)  I'm just concerned that they didn't see fit to mention the word """"female"""" in the summary, and perceive a blasé attitude to potentially significant data which is dully familiar from reading the few hundred papers I came across back in the day.  It wasn't unusual to find overlapping trials from two different papers which gave opposite conclusions, or to see lines like, """"while not significant, this data implies.."""" which is the kind of horseshit that makes physicists snort with laughter.

I agree that this research is useful, and of course it contributes to our understanding beyond the specific constraints of the trials reported, but the way it's presented, and the way the linked article reported it, weren't quite as honest as I'd like.",,pineapplecharm,1,t1_dmoi8hi,dmoqy61,t3_6yeq2s,t5_2qhqb,1504797459,dmoi8hi,"I have to admit I'm a little surprised at this kind of talk from fellow a Psychology grad. The title could have mentioned it was a female only study, but that's just the title, they expect people to read if not the whole paper then at the very least, intro, results and discussion which should give ample insight as to their reasoning.

Again, as a psychology grad I'm astounded you've got to degree level and haven't learnt about applicability and generalisability. Of course the findings are narrow and only apply to women. But the researchers would never seek to claim otherwise. The results show how obedient women *can* be when placed in certain situations.

You also seem to have a dissonance between what you want to see.

Factor in by far the most generous confidence intervals in modern science and you have, basically, evidence homeopathy.  Fucking psychology, man. 

Yes, this *one* study shows a particularly strict set of arguments about obedience in women. However when you combime that study with the huge number of other studies, conferences, papers, and theses on the topic of obedience (not all of which will be classic experiments, there are a large number of natural experiments and observational studies on the topic). You are able to develop at least an informed opinion on how people generally will operate when responding to situations where obedience is required/desired.

If you draw a straight line through Norway and double it in the same direction you get to northern Morocco, that is true.

Using the tool I linked above, you'll find that the true distance, in miles across the globe's surface, doesn't get that far south.

That's a straight north/south reflection as per the 'stand it up on the southern point and let it drop' wording suggests.

I may have a short attention span but I'm pretty sure exactly this was in the film. The presenter explicitly asks a thief how he feels about hurting people on minimum wage to make a dishonest buck.  I'm not sure that glamorises anything.

It's ironic that someone on this thread is accusing this film of pandering to """"pearl clutching"""" drama queens, when basically every post ITT is doing exactly that without having actually watched the thing.

Full marks for knowing the correct declension of a Latin neuter noun, but sadly you wanted the singular on this occasion.

See, people; this is what happens when you try and show off your classical education - everyone gets confused.  If you're writing in English the plural should really be """"millenniums"""".  Who singles out just the plural for parent language grammar?  What about the vocative or ablative?  When was the last time you saw someone write, """"this is the longest standing tradition of the millennii"""" or """"I wish I could send eighties fashion back to the last millennio""""?

Not long after the first hornblowers started the watch, the town got warning of a viking army headed our way.  The town elders got together and did the smart thing, paid the army off to go sack somebody else.  It worked.

Also, part of the hornblower's job is to find the mayor and tell him the watch is set.  I've several times seen the hornblower come to various pubs to find the guy, and heard a local legend that hornblowers in the past have located the mayor at ... not his own house.  But a job's a job, so they made their announcement outside and left.

On top of the obelisk (which is pretty tall) is a golden horn, not unlike the one the hornblower blows.  Legend has it that there're gold coins inside, and every so often somebody tries to climb up to get them.  There's noting in there - they take the horn down every couple of decades for a cleaning, if there were coins they're long gone.

And sorry Mr. Pickles, but the last hornblower told me (and everyone) that the hornblowers have missed like thirty-something days for various reasons, still quite the record considering this really has been going on for a millennia.

The difference you will see between cyclists and pedestrians is the fact that cyclists are moving around and as such are more likely to be moving out of polution and into 'fresh' air. As such don't get the same pollution levels as kerbside.

Once your crossing is out of the way, my recommendation would be to ride along the Lea Valley canal towpath.

    const YEARS_PER_CENTURY = 100;
    const YEARS_PER_DECADE = 10;

    const MONTHS_PER_QUARTER = 3;

    const DAYS_PER_WEEK = 7;
    const HOURS_PER_DAY = 24;
    const MINUTES_PER_HOUR = 60;
    const SECONDS_PER_MINUTE = 60;

Months per quarter?  Give me a break.  Look, all code is on a sliding scale from unintelligibly concise to confusingly verbose.  For me, this is too far towards the latter.  Constants are defined so that you can adjust them centrally, right?  But until we all lose our minds and decide to decimalise time the number of milliseconds in a minute isn't going to change, like, ever.  The only other reason would be clarity of code, which is easily achieved with comments, or indeed variable names.  Who the fuck wants to see:

    $msinyr = MILLISECONDS_IN_A_SECOND * SECONDS_IN_A_MINUTE * MINUTES_IN_AN_HOUR * HOURS_IN_A_DAY * DAYS_IN_A_WEEK * WEEKS_IN_A_YEAR;

when you can just put

    $milliseconds_in_a_year = 31557600000;

or

    $timeout = microtime() + 31557600000; // a year from now

If the number of days is going to change then of course that should be factored out *but not as a constant*.  If you're editing source code as part of your normal operations, you're doing it wrong.

Now, this also brings up another problem which is that multiplying all those constants together in my example will give you the wrong answer because there aren't precisely 52 weeks in a year.  So by defining all these constants you're actually just laying a big, fat trap for some poor sap to walk into when his mind is on other things.  By actually typing in the calculation you will go """"60 x 60 x 24 x oh wait should I put 365 or 365.25"""" which engages your brain with the problem rather than concentrating on not mis-spelling your verbose constant names.

Okay, some people might not know there are 365 days in a year.  Or 91 days might not be obviously 13 weeks at a glance, and I've often put something like:

    $days = 9*7; // nine weeks

but if you can't do the mental maths to convert *years* to *decades* without having it spelled out to you, you're in the wrong job.  We have decimalisation *precisely because* multiples of ten are bleedin' obvious.  Be honest - a sixteen character constant name is no substitute for a single zero.

1. Ensure everybody is safe and contact control
2. Light Up a fag and clock off as your hours are up.
3. Start a punch up with some of the more mouthy commuters
4. Continue as normal assuming it will be OK so as not to delay the train

6349,"&gt; I think we need more work done on understanding what it means to be a man, and that feminism needs to let men in on the conversation instead of pushing them away with terms as mansplaining.

I agree with everything you're saying, except this. Men don't need women to tell them how to be men. 

Feminism has always been about equal rights and opportunities...for women. Now that they've achieved that (in the West anyway), it seems 4th wave is all about advancing the agenda that women are more powerful than men and furthermore men should be more like women. This is a gravely worrisome development that needs to be kept in check.",,platonic_bj,1,t1_dv6rxs8,dv85ve6,t3_81zlpy,t5_3172q,1520277807,dv6rxs8,"Interesting question and one I’ve been thinking about lately. I think that men don’t identify as feminist because a lot of narrative, especially online, rides on the trope that men are uncontrolable beasts. Though there are of course many more feminist viewpoints out there, this one especially makes for good click baits and gets shared at lot. 

Of course most guys are gonna be offended by that, as most guys don’t recognize this experience. Especially in younger generation men  have been raised with explicite and implicite femimist values, and a lot of the work done by previous generations of feminist have become part of our culture at large. Values such as equal oppertunity, girls can do anything boys can etc have become pretty normal. In other words, great strides have been made in our undrstanding of what a woman is and can be.

The other way around not so much. It’s much less accepted for boys to be into ballet, or wearing a dress, or to consider traditionally female jobs, such as daycare (this one especially is of limits for men because they are ‘uncontrollable beasts and will molest your child’, or so the narrative goes).  I think we need more work done on understanding what it means to be a man, and that feminism needs to let men in on the conversation instead of pushing them away with terms as mansplaining. 

So in short, man often don’t identify as feminist because feminism doesn’t represent their experience, eventhough most do share the basic values of the feminist movement. ",,Mechanical4ngel,2,t1_dv6h2kr,dv6rxs8,t3_81zlpy,t5_3172q,1520207105

And some other areas like law, tenured professors, and so on.)

So what? Women receive much, much lighter sentences for the same crime than men. 

Which brings me to a general point. Feminism is constantly arguing under a false premise, namely to assume that men in power use that power to help men exclusively. It's simply false. Men do **not** feel particular allegiance towards other men based on gender. It's pretty much a projection from women's/feminist's side, considering that women have a much stronger in-group bias. They know women in power are more likely to focus on women's desires and thus assume men to be the same. On the contrary, men adore women and often go out of their way to help and please women, often throwing fellow men under the bus in the process. Funnily enough, this lack of inherent solidarity amongst men is one reason why the MRM has a much more difficult standing than feminism. 

Feminists need to explain this: If men in power were such horrible sexists, feminism would not have happened. Instead, it's literally the most succesful social revolutionary movement in history, installing itself as a major political power within a short amount of time. And while other revolutionaries often paid in blood (lots of blood), feminists barely bled and died for their cause. It was an incredibly smooth ride compared to Europe's worker's rights movement of the late 19th century or the various national independency movements (India, North Africa etc.) of the mid 20th century. The immense success of feminism directly contradicts feminist conspiracy theories of powerful male cabals who consciously and exclusively oppress women.

My parents just ended up sending me to “wilderness therapy” and “therapeutic boarding school” which are places where parents can essentially lock up their kids for years and have them completely isolated from society and have no freedom at all. I’m 18 now, and I got out only a month ago.

Ok, so the US government and top executives in private sector are overwhelmingly male. But who put those men there? Here's an interesting stat: In the last US election, [53% of voters were women and 47% men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016#Voter_demographics). 

[Women control 60% of all wealth in the US and account for 80% of all consumer spending](http://shurwest.com/2017/03/14/financial-facts-womens-history-month/) even though they earn less in the aggregate. Whose money are they spending?

Well, it's either their higher-earning partners (men mostly), or it's the government. [Twice as many women as men have used food stamps.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/12/the-politics-and-demographics-of-food-stamp-recipients/) [Female-householder programs are the single greatest recipients of means-tested assistance programs.](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-97.html)  

(In fairness, there are some important fields of influence where men still dominate: [About 2/3 of all judges are male.](https://www.nawj.org/statistics/2016-us-state-court-women-judges) And some other areas like law, tenured professors, and so on.)

I'm not even going to bring up all the other stats to show the many ways men have it worse than women (shorter life spans, far higher incarceration rates, higher suicide rates, higher alcoholism and drug addition rate, far more likely to be victims of violent crime, etc). I'm not going to talk about whether it's fair or not how much easier it is for a woman to get laid than it is for a man (why do you think prostitution is the world's oldest profession?) I'm not going to talk about how it's the women who rule households in almost every society on the planet (""""who wears the pants"""" is an ironic question). I'm not going to talk about how girls and young women are surrounded by media messaging constantly telling them how great they are (acknowledging there are also impossible beauty standards imposed on them) while at the same time telling boys they're all potential rapists or losers.

Hovering is staying overtop of a fixed point. If that fixed point is moving away from you (or you from it) you are not hovering. You also would have a velocity relative to the earth, or landspeed.

If the earth were in a vacuum, and somehow the helicopter still worked, you still would be going in the direction that you left the earth in, as you'd still have that momentum swinging you around in the same direction.

Now what IS kind of cool is the Coriolis Effect. This is kind of what you are asking about, but actually happens. This is the best write up I can find thats easy to understand. This happens to sniper bullets over long distances, and long distance aircraft as they fly across the earth. Basically if you start at the equator and fly straight towards the north pole, and donot steer, you end up going east, or left, on the globe. To fly """"straight north"""" you actually would have to fly towards the west to compensate.

To combat this and to prove they are better than Democrats at running the government, they will actually be willing to work with the other side and make compromises. If they want to show how well a Republican government runs they will have to actually work with Democrats.

2. The same thing the last four years have given us: gridlock. If they are unwilling to work with Democrats or vehemently push the idea that the midterms gave them a mandate then nothing's going to happen. This can happen for many reasons: if the republicans can't control their tea party radicals and get them to actually compromise on good sense legislation, they cannot work with Obama due to creating such a large amount of hate for him, the Democrats want to filibuster most things even if republicans offer productive compromises (unlikely as Democrats have no incentive to seem like the intransigent ones at the moment and hurt 2016 prospects), or they are just unwilling to write legislation that can pass.

I recently became the foreman at my job, as the previous one left, and I was next in line. About a week into my new commission, four members of my crew suddenly started calling out to deal with some serious personal shit. 

Let's call these four E (male, spoiler, is ultimately the villain in this story, kind of looks like Christian Bale. Really loves the movie Pain and Gain), A (female, dated E after meeting him via work. Broke up with him a few months ago, went off for the summer, came back, and sort of started to rekindle things with E.), B (male, E's cousin, got E the job. Really big ogre of a man, looks nothing like E.), and J (B's best friend, also went to college with A and me.).

So, I start getting tidbits of info about what's going on, why I'm losing workers at crucial times, but nothing concrete. Something is going on with E. Probably in regards to A. I still can't imagine what could be so important as to miss so much work. 

Fast forward a bit B and A come back to work, happy and cheery. J isn't in that day, because he has rehearsal for a show he's in. I know A's been dealing with some shit, so I give her a hug, even though I don't know the problem. She accepts the hug, even holds it a bit long - I can tell she needed that hug. She gets to work, is laughing, joking around like always. 

About midday, I realize I haven't seen A or B for a bit. I don't pay too much attention. I call a 10 for everyone, because I want a cigarette. B comes back and lights up, not saying anything. A comes back sobbing, gathering her stuff, says someone broke into her house, she has to go. She speeds off. 

B makes a phone call to (I later found out) E's mom, who lives 3-4 hours away. I here things like """"E is with you right? What do you mean no? I TOLD YOU TO KEEP HIM UP THERE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DONE???"""" 

Since this shit started, I recently got the whole story, so now let's pause, rewind a bit, and fill in the fact gaps... 

E tried to kill himself one night. A decided they shouldn't get back together, because of work and everything, and E couldn't take that answer, swallowed a bunch of pills. A rushed to his house, made him puke, and called 911. For the next few weeks, B, A, and J were rotating calling out so that one of them could be with E at all times. E got violent a few times. His emotions became erratic. He loved them for being there for him, and he hated them for holding him down, restraining him. He used coercion and even physical force to get A to sleep with him, though he backed off on the latter. 

One night, B was able to get E's family to drive down and pick him up, take him back home. They had to physically shove him into the car. He broke the antenna off A's car in the struggle. B tells the family, """"He's sick, he needs help. Keep him up there, don't let him come back here."""" Then we don't here from E for 3 days. 

Flash back to present scenario, the cops caught the guy who broke into A's house. Surprise, surprise it's E. 

A lives with her mom, and has cameras around the house. She knows more or less what's been going on, and on a bad feeling hunch, she checks the cameras' live feed from work. Three of them are dark. She sees a figure, covering his face with a sheet, throw the sheet onto the camera. This guy knows where all the cameras are. She calls the cops, then calls A. By the time A gets there, they have E in custody. She goes into her bedroom. Her cat is on her bed. It's not sleeping, it's dead. It wasn't bludgeoned, it was strangled. E has cat claw marks on his arm. 

E is now in a high security psych prison with no bail, no contact with anyone but his lawyer and the doctor. A hasn't been back to work yet. B and J are working, but are noticeably different. 

These aren't just my employees, they're my friends. Well, I was friends with who I *thought* E was, but not the person behind the mask. ",,casualdelirium,12,t3_3o7duo,cvuzwlk,t3_3o7duo,t5_2qh1i,1444502204

6471,"Middle East[edit]
In 1952, when Egypt had been taken over by General Mohammed Naguib, Skorzeny was sent to Egypt the following year by former General Reinhard Gehlen (who was now working for the CIA) to act as Naguib's military advisor. Skorzeny recruited a staff made up of former SS and Wehrmacht officers to train the Egyptian army. Among these officers were SS General Wilhelm Farmbacher, Panzer General Oskar Munzel, Leopold Gleim, head of the Gestapo Department for Jewish Affairs in Poland, and Joachim Daemling, former chief of the Gestapo in Düsseldorf. In addition to training the army, Skorzeny also trained Arab volunteers in commando tactics for possible use against British troops stationed in the Suez Canal zone. Several Palestinian refugees also received commando training, and Skorzeny planned their raids into Israel via the Gaza Strip in 1953-1954. One of these Palestinians was Yasser Arafat.[27] He would eventually serve as an adviser to Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.[28]

Skorzeny later provided intelligence to the Mossad about ex-Nazi scientists working for the Egyptian government. Skorzeny agreed to cooperate with Israel on the condition that Simon Wiesenthal erase his name from the list of wanted Nazi war criminals and act to have an arrest warrant against him cancelled. Though Wiesenthal rejected this request, Skorzeny decided in the end to cooperate with the Mossad anyway.[29][30]",,sosorrynoname,2,t1_cx3v8q7,cx3wv6e,t3_3t64ld,t5_2s7yq,1447804106,cx3v8q7,"And Wernher von Braun noted Nazi and member of the SS helped America's rocket program no end with the help with a few other Nazis.

I would like to offer the mindframe and standpoint of President Obama, who is currently fighting for the refugees to an overwhelmingly opposing American public, as well as my own point of view. Please read fully before downvoting, I am simply trying to speak for people whom few seem to be speaking for.

“Prejudice and discrimination helps ISIL and undermines our national security,” Obama said.
""""Refugees who end up in the United States are the most... thuroughly investigated individuals that ever arrived on american shores.""""
After visiting a classroom of Syrian refugees, Obama said """"If you were a parent and you saw those kids, and you thought about what they had gone through? The notion that we [the American public] could not find a home, for them, anywhere in the United States of America? ...That is contrary to our values.""""

The majority of refugees ARE women and children. Opposers such as Trump seem to be ignoring this fact. You are promoting the notion to deny entire families the basic rights we have here that they want so desperately. 

Furthermore, denying the refugees the opportunity to enter the United States and other first world countries alike promotes the mixed feelings some of these people may have, and may push them to become terrorists themselves. This is what obama is referring to when he speaks of ISIS's """"promotion of fear"""" in the American (and the world's) people. Fear keeps us from helping these people because of things they hypothetically could do. Intolerance and fear in first world countries has a direct correlation to promoting hatred twoards us in the people that we are denying entry.

Reality is that the majority of these refugees are simply trying to escape the hell they used to call home. By sending them back, we are sending them back to the people they are running away from (and who knows what torturous methods these radicals would dream up for deserters), back to the possibility of being bombed by us, and promoting hatred, possibly pushing some of them to join ISIS. We are effectively doing nothing in the long term but creating more enemies for ourselves, and killing these people by collateral by bombings. At the very least, we are sending them back to the hell holes they called home.

Think about what these people are going through over there right now. Sure, we could send them away for the temporary satisfaction that we prevented a miniscule fraction of the refugees who are potential terrorists. But in the long run if we let them in, we would be saving many lives and limiting the world enemies we have. In your heart I know you know we cannot turn down tens of thousands of innocent people because we are scared of what very, very few of them could hypothetically do. We must be strong, and help out those who call on our capable helping hands, because they need our help. Simple as that.

It is wrong that we turn these people away, that is what it boils down to. It goes against the morals we all stand for. Religious freedom, justice for all. The right to vote, express concerns, individuality. Please, spread the word. We need to change the mind of the American people and any others who oppose helping Syrian refugees. It is WRONG to turn innocent people away in their hour of need, and doing so because we are scared of what some of them could do will only hurt both parties in the long run.

The solution is simple, do not register to vote.

Most poor people do not register to vote, at least most of the people I know, specifically for this reason.

As a minimum wage worker that was called for jury duty and desperately pleaded to not serve due to financial hardship, as in I would literally lose my house, I was rescheduled for the end of the year and luckily was never called. Had I been I would have lost everything.

And believe you me, no lawyer would stand up for me when I would inevitably get fired (being fired would not be the cause of losing my house, not earning money for a week would be the cause, the firing would inevitably follow).

After telling my friends and family they told me the mistake I made.

Their namings were separate occurrences, with Iceland colonised many generations before Greenland.  Greenland's name was of course a tad optimistic *if applied to the entire island generally*, but this was a natural consequence of the desire to draw colonists (from among the Norse themselves) to a new colony.  And the motivation to explore and colonise was strong, particular in Erik the Red, who was instrumental to Greenland's colonisation.  
  
While Greenland was not so green as its name suggested, the promotional description is in keeping with, for example, the less than credibly idyllic description given to [Vinland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinland) likewise, in the sagas.  One does not brag of having discovered a glacial waste.  One brags of having discovered a glorious new land.  
  
But perhaps most importantly, the part of Greenland colonised by the Norse was *not* a glacial waste, during the [Medieval Warm Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period).  Indeed, it was *green*.  So the description was not a deception, as far as that goes.  Agriculture was possible then, though it is not now.

Since he only cited another blogger for his source (what's up with all the blog sources in columns these days?), I figured I would look him up to see why I should take him as a scientific source on such an important issue. It turns out that this man has no scientific schooling, and has argued the following against broad scientific consensus:

* There is no link between passive smoking and cancer.
* Intelligent design is a superior alternative to current evolutionary theory.
* White asbestos exposure does not present a risk of mesothelioma (this was called out as dangerously wrong and was even countered by the head of the group that conducted the study he """"sourced"""" from).

I encourage anyone willing to take the words of just two men to read up on the controversies surrounding their opinion and methodologies - Wikipedia articles for [Christopher Booker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Booker) and [Steven Goddard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Goddard) will give you somewhere to start. We are talking about an extremely important and pressing issue, regardless of which side you are on. Hopefully if you are making up your mind you are trained in the field or using credible news sources who are citing peer-reviewed scientific studies as a basis for their news article. Anyone can start up a blog and put their opinion out there based off of a set of data points. However, that should not be expected to be taken as a scientific standard or that presidential candidates should base their views on climate science off of them.

&gt; We also asked experts in the use of human tissue for research about the potential for profit. Sherilyn J. Sawyer, the director of Harvard University and Brigham and Women’s Hospital’s “biorepository,” told us that “there’s no way there’s a profit at that price.” She continued in an email:
&gt; Sawyer, July 20: In reality, $30-100 probably constitutes a loss for [Planned Parenthood]. The costs associated with collection, processing, storage, and inventory and records management for specimens are very high. Most hospitals will provide tissue blocks from surgical procedures (ones no longer needed for clinical purposes, and without identity) for research, and cost recover for their time and effort in the range of $100-500 per case/block. In the realm of tissues for research $30-100 is completely reasonable and normal fee.
&gt; 
&gt; Jim Vaught, president of the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories and formerly the deputy director of the National Cancer Institute’s Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research, told us in an email that “$30 to $100 per sample is a reasonable charge for clinical operations to recover their costs for providing tissue.” In fact, he said, the costs to a clinic are often much higher, but most operations that provide this kind of tissue have “no intention of fully recovering [their] costs, much less making a profit.”
&gt; Carolyn Compton, the chief medical and science officer of Arizona State University’s National Biomarkers Development Alliance and a former director of biorepositories and biospecimen research at the National Cancer Institute, agreed that this was “a modest price tag for cost recovery.” Compton told us in an email: ” ‘Profit’ is out of the question, in my mind. I would say that whoever opined about ‘profit’ knows very little about the effort and expense involved in providing human biospecimens for research purposes.”


&gt; What Does the Law Say?
&gt; 
&gt; In a statement made to CNN, another presidential candidate, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, called the practice discussed in the video a “clear violation of federal law.” The “sale” of organs, both adult and fetal, for transplantation is indeed illegal, but donation of tissue — both from aborted fetuses and from adults — is not. And payment for “reasonable” costs is also allowed under the law.
&gt; The video itself highlights a portion of title 42 of the U.S. code, which reads: “It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce.” The law does include fetal tissue in its definitions. It says that the term “valuable consideration” doesn’t include “reasonable payments” for removal, transportation, preservation and other associated costs.
&gt; In 1993, a law pertaining to federally funded NIH research was enacted that allows donation of fetal tissue from induced abortions if certain criteria are met. These include that the woman donating is not aware of the recipients of the tissue, and that the abortion timing, procedures or method itself would not be altered for the sole purpose of obtaining the tissue.
&gt; The 1993 law also says that it is unlawful “for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce.” The law again excludes the types of costs Nucatola discussed in the video: “The term ‘valuable consideration’ does not include reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue.”
&gt; The American Medical Association echoes this in its ethical guidelines on the issue: “Fetal tissue is not provided in exchange for financial remuneration above that which is necessary to cover reasonable expenses.”

""""...But why, exactly, is that phrase so problematic? On Reddit, user GeekAesthete broke it down with a perfect analogy:

""""Imagine that you're sitting down to dinner with your family, and while everyone else gets a serving of the meal, you don't get any. So you say, """"I should get my fair share."""" And as a direct response to this, your dad corrects you, saying, """"Everyone should get their fair share."""" Now, that's a wonderful sentiment — Indeed, everyone should, and that was kinda your point in the first place: that you should be a part of everyone, and you should get your fair share also. However, dad's smart-ass comment just dismissed you and didn't solve the problem that you still haven't gotten any!

""""The problem is that the statement """"I should get my fair share"""" had an implicit """"too"""" at the end: """"I should get my fair share, too, just like everyone else."""" But your dad's response treated your statement as though you meant """"only I should get my fair share,"""" which clearly was not your intention. As a result, his statement that """"everyone should get their fair share,"""" while true, only served to ignore the problem you were trying to point out.

""""Just like asking dad for your fair share, the phrase """"black lives matter"""" also has an implicit """"too"""" at the end: It's saying that black lives should also matter. But responding to this by saying """"all lives matter"""" is willfully going back to ignoring the problem. It's a way of dismissing the statement by falsely suggesting that it means """"only black lives matter,"""" when that is obviously not the case. And so saying """"all lives matter"""" as a direct response to """"black lives matter"""" is essentially saying that we should just go back to ignoring the problem.""""

* Low-income areas have less access to fresh grocers

* When available, healthy foods - especially produce - are of a lesser quality in low income area grocers

* Higher quality food is more expensive; consequently lower-quality food is cheaper.

* Low-income areas have a higher concentration of fast food restaurants

* Low-income families and houses have less access to exercise facilities and resources such as payed gyms, sports programs, and open areas such as parks, or when available such spaces are not attractive(ie run-down, dirty, unsafe)

* They have less access to affordable health-care(perhaps less so now with Obamacare though)

* If food is scarce, a person is more likely to overeat when food does become available, in a """"feast or famine"""" mentality in preparation for another possible fast.

**3.**) Use crosswalks.  Don't cross against the lights, even though the college students do it.  They get run over a lot anyway, so they're not setting a great example.


**4.)** Don't call the city 'Beantown.'  That's ridiculous.


**5.)** Upon finding out that you are talking to a local, it's fine to ask for advice for things to do (I love suggesting this stuff!).  But don't roll your eyes when we suggest something that's actually interesting and not touristy, and then buy tickets to the Swan Boats.


**6.)**  Don't make fun of the accents.  Don't ask me why I don't have an accent.  I don't know.  Some of us just don't.


**7.)**  Don't be afraid to use the subway to get around.  Most of the best places are best accessed that way.

**8.)** Don't stop in the middle of our narrow sidewalks.  Most of us are trying to get to and from work.


**9.)** *Most importantly.* don't judge us by our cool and reserved Yankee aloofness.  There are a lot of us, myself included, that **LOVE** our city, take pride in it, and will jump at the chance to offer help or tips to a visiting tourist.

6903,"The Daily Mail recently reported that the University of Edinburgh found “for onshore wind, the monthly ‘load factor’ of turbines – a measure of how much electricity they generate as a percentage of how much they could produce if on at full power all the time - dropped from a high of 24 per cent in the first year after construction, to just 11 per cent after 15 years.”

That’s a 55 percent drop, for you dinosaurs who still think that is important — and that is just for turbines still working.

There’s a reason why so many wind projects got so much attention on the drawing board, but when it comes time to build them, they wither away. The offshore wind project in Delaware is a good example: One day it was hailed as the secret to the universe. The next day, it was gone. It disappeared down a black hole when people who actually had to pay for it and build it figured out what it actually was going to cost them.

It was the real numbers that scared them off. In America, these numbers are harder to come by — another red flag for investors — but as many as 1 in 4 wind turbines just does not work. Some do not even spin. Others spin, but do not generate electricity, so it is hard to tell by looking at them.

Hawaii provides the favorite example: The 37 turbines at the Kamaoa Wind Farm stood derelict for more than six years after it was discovered that repairs were more expensive than replacements. This is just one of six abandoned wind farms in one of the most wind-ideal places on the planet.

The Altamont Pass Wind Farm in Northern California used to be the largest wind farm on Earth. Now it is best known as the largest killer of eagles and other raptors. The turbines are shut down for four months a year to protect the birds during their migration. So much for that pro-forma. 

As many as 4,500 wind turbines have been built — and abandoned — in California alone. 

How long can that last? Ask that question of a True Believer at your own peril. They say  making money is no longer the point of being in business; saving the planet is.

Even Al Gore is getting out of alternative energy such as wind. Just check the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings for his company, Generation Investment. Not a wind play in the portfolio. 

There may be one million reasons to invest in wind, or to install a windmill. Most involve bragging to your friends that you are saving the planet. But if you need the energy or the money, don’t — because right now, wind is still nothing more than a faith-based initiative.

Wittman's memoir](http://www.amazon.com/Priceless-Undercover-Rescue-Worlds-Treasures/dp/0307461483/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450362021&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=priceless+how+i+went+undercover+to+rescue+the+world%27s+stolen+treasures) and [journalistic research into famous modern art heists](http://www.amazon.com/The-Rescue-Artist-Thieves-Masterpiece/dp/0060531185/ref=pd_sim_14_6?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=51mhWJa1ggL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR106%2C160_&amp;refRID=0Z4NEV65DX4FERWG8V4E), the answer is probably not, at least as far as art crime goes. While there appears to be evidence that there are criminal gangs who specialize in dealing with stolen art, it's extremely unlikely that their operations are being bankrolled by a secretive, wealthy benefactor who hides away his stolen treasures for private use. There is one book called [Stolen Masterpiece Tracker](http://www.amazon.com/Stolen-Masterpiece-Tracker-Thomas-McShane/dp/1569803145/ref=pd_sim_14_96?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=41xbC61nLzL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR105%2C160_&amp;refRID=0Z4NEV65DX4FERWG8V4E) by a retired FBI agent named Thomas McShane which claims that almost every art theft ever is absolutely ordered by some rich person who hires a team of criminals, however he offers absolutely no evidence to support this and quite frankly the rest of the book makes him sound like a bit of a loony old man so I can't say I trust what he says (not a terrible read if you're really interested in the topic though).





The boring truth is that, as far as we can tell, most art is stolen as a type of black market collateral or bearer bond. Valuable paintings and other artworks are often bartered for drugs, held as collateral on loans between groups, and sometimes used like retirement funds for career criminals. I can't recall which exact painting it was, but a few years ago I was reading a news article, and one of the works listed in [Museum of the Missing](http://www.amazon.com/Museum-Missing-History-Art-Theft/dp/1402728298/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450362847&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=museum+of+the+missing+a+history+of+art+theft) was found practically by accident when police raided an apartment looking for a suitcase of drugs, only to find that the case had already been exchanged for the stolen painting. 




The laws in various countries for the statute of limitations and ownership also make using pieces as long term investments reasonably practical. If a thief can steal a painting and successfully hide it from law enforcement for the period outlined by the law, they can legally claim themselves as the rightful owners of that piece, even if they were convicted and served time for its theft. This often ends up being a few decades but nonetheless, for someone who has no legal money to invest it's a tempting prospect, especially when the punishments for such crimes are relatively lenient.




Other times it's the thieves themselves who want to keep the artwork for their personal collections. A recent example is [a French man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Breitwieser) (sorry for the wiki link but I can't remember which books he was listed in) who simply liked the art so much that he wanted it for himself. There was a similar case investigated by the FBI of a man in New York a few years back who liked to use his stolen art to help him seduce the young men he brought home.




tl;dr As far as art crime goes, there are several motives for thefts, but as far as we can tell none of them involve a greedy billionaire hiring a gang to provide him with his own secret room of treasures. It's certainly possible that statistically there are one or two people like that in the world, but even if this were the case it would only account for a very tiny percentage of art thefts. In reality it's mostly just regular people being greedy.


If you're interested in learning about art crime I highly suggest starting with [The Rescue Artist](http://www.amazon.com/The-Rescue-Artist-Thieves-Masterpiece/dp/0060531185/ref=pd_sim_14_9?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=51mhWJa1ggL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR106%2C160_&amp;refRID=16N6CPE80QS1W2Q67W2J) by Edward Dolnick.

There are plenty of other great books on thefts throughout the more modern era, such as [The Napoleon of Crime](http://www.amazon.com/Napoleon-Crime-Times-Worth-Master/dp/0307886468/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450364104&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+napoleon+of+crime) and [Flawless](http://www.amazon.com/Flawless-Inside-Largest-Diamond-History/dp/1402797559/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450364133&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=flawless+diamond) that aren't strictly art related but still good reads.

United States Jaycees (1984) that """"implicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment"""" is """"a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends.""""[230] In Roberts the Court held that associations may not exclude people for reasons unrelated to the group's expression, such as gender.[231]",t1_csoq7p4,sosorrynoname,1,t1_csodthy,csoq7p4,t3_3bmfff,t5_2s7tt,1435762711,csodthy,Show me a statute where it says you have a right to discriminate against a person for any reason. ,t1_csodthy,DCMikeO,1,t1_csntitn,csodthy,t3_3bmfff,t5_2s7tt,1435726346

Note that the Planck time is not regarded as a minimum time interval, rather it's a characteristic time interval on which quantum gravity is thought to operate at, lower than which our notion of time would change.

Currently listening to his 4 part series about Genghis Khan...and it's amazing. He has a way with setting up imagery that stays with you.  
  
Currently, the one I'm thinking of is when a Muslim King sends a spy mission to China in order to see whether or not it's a place he can conquer. He doesn't know much about the place beyond some stories he's heard from passing merchants, so he sends a man named Baha' al-Din along with a few dozen men to check things out and report back.  
  
Well, as it turns out this is also the time when Genghis Khan is laying waste to China. So when al-Din gets to China it becomes quickly apparent to him that there is something very, very wrong with this place called China. As they travel the countryside, things start to pop up, such as when they thought they saw a snow capped mountain in the distance...only to realize that it was actually a giant pile of bones, so large that it had appeared to be a mountain from the distance. Or the fact that they eventually had to get off the road because the ground had turned into a greasy marsh because thousands upon thousands of bodies had decomposed on the road. The stench of the road was in fact so bad, that several member of the expedition actually got sick and died.  
  
Eventually they reached what is now modern day Beijing, a city of well over a million people called Zhongdu. Now at this time, this was one of the, if not THE largest city on earth. The Muslims had never seen a city  of this size, it was massive with immense walls, hundreds of towers, and gates, and parapets. To them it represented a country of gargantuan size and wealth..and they found it utterly decimated.  
  
So now al-Din had several things to report back to his king. He had to come back and explain that he'd found a kingdom of previously unheard levels of wealth and power...and that **something** had crushed them with terrifying thoroughness and brutality.  
   
--------------------------   
  
I do the story very little justice, so I very much recommend you check out the podcast. It also goes into some very interesting themes. Such as how a good deal of history is actually Revisionist History. With many historians retroactively attributing good things from the conquests of great and famount men...when in actuality, those good things such as the spread of cultures or the unification of people were actually unintended boons that came as a result of mass murder and conquest. The idea that time has robbed of the ability to see the cost of those great things we now enjoy.    
   
**TL;DR:** I am a poor wordsmith but Hardcore History is an awesome podcast about how hardcore history really is.

The investment banks are allowed to engage in risky investments but they are using the money of investors who understand the risk.   For years there were rules in place that kept these two types of banks separate and restricted the regular banks from using your and my money for these types of investments.   

During the Clinton administration the rules were changed (it was a republican bill but had support from dems and was signed into law by Clinton) and suddenly regular banks were allowed to use our deposited money to make risky investments.   Fast forward to the 2000's and Dubya was pushing for every American to own their own home.   Sounded like an admirable goal.  Except the banks were giving out loans to people who they knew would never pay them back.  

Why would they do that, you ask?   Because they would then sell that debt to other companies.   Those companies, knowing full well it was bad debt, packaged a whole lot of those mortgages together and sold them as good investments.   The stock market was booming but it was based largely on these crappy mortgages. 

Also we now know that the federal reserve (which is supposed to regulate banks) was turning a blind eye to these activities.  So finally the banks went to the government and admitted what they had been doing and basically said if the government didn't bail them out the shit was really going to hit the fan. 

So,  all these people who had bought homes they couldn't afford got foreclosed on.   All these extra houses on the market caused everybody's home values to plummet.   The banks were forced to really tighten up their lending practices which coupled with the crashing stock market killed the construction industry for awhile.

* 90% of the worlds glaciers are melting and are increasing in rate. (Greenland’s ice loss has accelerated from 51 billion tons per year in the 1990s to 263 billion tons per year today.) 
* """"Over 1992–2013, the mass loss [of the West Antarctic]is 83±5 Gt/yr with an acceleration of 6.1±0.7 Gt/yr. Over 2003–2011, the mass loss is 102±10 Gt/yr with an acceleration of 15.7±4.0 Gt/yr."""" (Sutterley et al 2014)
* Both the Arctic and Antarctic have increased in their melting rate as well. Compared to the Arctic, the Antarctic is surrounded by water so when it loses it's fresh water it flows outward and creates more sea ice
* Mountain pine beetles and other pests such as ticks are moving further north and are able to reproduce more frequently. (In the past it was difficult to even find a pine beetle since they had a two week window where they were emerging)
* Gehrels and Woodworth 2013: the rate in sea level rise has exceeded the rate of the Holocene and has been increasing since ~1925.... and the rate is currently accelerating.
* Coral reefs are experiencing more stress from frequent sea surface temperature anomalies and 30% increase in ocean acidity. They have to maintain a certain pH inside their tissue for metabolic processes to occur and yet they're competing with a changing pH of the ocean. Now there are more frequent bleaching events and disease outbreaks caused by this increase in stress. Other organisms such as krill are having a difficult time metabolizing their food in acidic waters. Krill in the arctic (where ocean acidification is greater) also have a slower metabolism in more acidic water. 
* Cyclones are formed from simple thunderstorms. However, these thunderstorms can only grow to cyclone strength with cooperation from both the ocean and the atmosphere. First of all, the ocean water itself must be warmer than **26.5 degrees Celsius (81°F)**. The heat and moisture from this warm water is ultimately the source of energy for cyclones. Sea *surface* temperature anomalies are becoming more common....which means the likelihood of cyclones occurring will increase.
* Some adult ocean organisms may fare fine in a more acidic world, but what about their eggs (lionfish can lay up to 2.5 million eggs a year and the majority of those eggs don't make it...so what about the few that do?) or the development of each organism or the protein and enzyme function necessary for metabolism, growth and reproduction? 80% (&gt;90,000 describes species) of all ocean organisms spend the beginning of their life as plankton and they all are part of an interconnected web (each step of their development may require different prey).

7190,"The Boston Regional Intelligence Center (BRIC), an arm of the Boston Police Department, released the “2016 Heroin Overdose Report” this week to inform government agencies of trends in opiate use in Boston.

BRIC found the majority of individuals arrested last year for Class A drug trafficking in the city of Boston were not U.S. citizens and most of those non-citizens were Dominican foreign nationals.

“An analysis of Class A Trafficking arrests showed that 39% of the arrestees claimed to have been born in the U.S., 26 percent claimed to have been born in Puerto Rico, and 65% were born in another country,” BRIC stated in the report.

Of the non-citizen heroin traffickers arrested in Boston, 84 percent are from the Dominican Republic.

“This suggest heroin trafficking in Boston is largely controlled by Dominican drug organizations,” the report states.

The report, which was shared with several state and federal agencies on Monday, is unclassified but has not been released to the public or to media.

Boston police suspect many non-citizens arrested for trafficking heroin may have also committed identity fraud, suggesting those traffickers are in the U.S. illegally.

“In 44% [of] cases where a person was arrested for Trafficking Class A in 2015 and 2016, and listed a place of birth other than the U.S., there were signs of past identity fraud or use of different names at booking,” the report states. “In 59% of the cases where the suspect listed Puerto Rico as their place of birth, there were signs of identity fraud and use of aliases.”",,sosorrynoname,0,t1_dit22nl,dit29kk,t3_6gp544,t5_2qh1i,1497292562,dit22nl,Are domestic terrorists your thing?,,Kahnonymous,0,t1_disvee9,dit22nl,t3_6gp544,t5_2qh1i,1497292352

After the war, the Mufti fled Germany and was instrumental in helping fleeing Nazi's after World War II to find refuge in the Middle East.

BRIC found the majority of individuals arrested last year for Class A drug trafficking in the city of Boston were not U.S. citizens and most of those non-citizens were Dominican foreign nationals.

“An analysis of Class A Trafficking arrests showed that 39% of the arrestees claimed to have been born in the U.S., 26 percent claimed to have been born in Puerto Rico, and 65% were born in another country,” BRIC stated in the report.

Of the non-citizen heroin traffickers arrested in Boston, 84 percent are from the Dominican Republic.

“This suggest heroin trafficking in Boston is largely controlled by Dominican drug organizations,” the report states.

The report, which was shared with several state and federal agencies on Monday, is unclassified but has not been released to the public or to media.

Boxborough police said that Eduardo Alementa Torres, 48, who is originally from Mexico, was driving a 1988 Chevrolet pickup truck with an expired inspection sticker when an officer saw him at about 10:45 a.m. on the southbound ramp from Massachusetts Avenue to Interstate 495 and pulled him over.

The officer saw an open beer bottle on the passenger seat and detected a strong odor of alcohol, police said. Torres failed a field sobriety test and submitted to a breath test, which showed that his blood alcohol level was .09 percent, according to police.

The legal limit to drive in Massachusetts is .08 percent.

Police said Torres had no identification on him and gave the officer a false name.

Torres was identified when police ran his fingerprints through an automated identification system, and police also learned that he had three prior drunken driving convictions in California and two in Massachusetts, authorities said.

Police said that Torres is a previously deported fugitive wanted by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

A suspected illegal immigrant from Mexico has been charged with drunk driving in a collision that killed another driver — a 66-year-old former missionary returning to his Noblesville, Indiana, home after a long night at work.

Elizabeth Vargas-Hernandez, 35, was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated causing death, WRTV-TV reported, adding that she also was cited for operating a vehicle without ever receiving a driver’s license.

State police told WRTV that Vargas-Hernandez, of Indianapolis, is believed to be an undocumented Mexican national.

The suspect was traveling at a high rate of speed on Interstate 465 around 2:30 a.m. Monday when she slammed her SUV into David Kriehn’s car, which careened off the highway and rolled over several times into a ditch, police told WTHR-TV.

Everyone has a slightly different version of what happened on that late-summer evening in Milford in 2011, but the gruesome details are consistent.

Police say Nicolas Guaman, an undocumented immigrant from Ecuador, was driving drunk with his son in the car when, near the corner of Fayette and Congress, he hit and killed 23-year-old Matthew Denice, a recent college graduate who was riding his motorcycle home.

It was the kind of summer evening when folks were out barbecuing on the lawn, and there were plenty of witnesses.

It's unclear how many times Denice was struck, but it's clear Guaman never bothered to stop and check. He drove off from the scene.

Now, nearly three years after the accident, Guaman goes on trial Wednesday morning in Worcester Superior Court. He faces seven charges: murder, manslaughter by motor vehicle, motor vehicle homicide while under the influence of alcohol and negligent operation, reckless endangerment of a child, leaving the scene of an accident causing death, failure to stop for a police officer and unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle.

His lawyer has asked for a bench trial, meaning the verdict is in the hands of the judge. There will be no jury.

A Rallying Cry Against Immigrants 

The accident's aftershocks still reverberate in Milford, a small MetroWest town with a population just under 28,000. It's also overwhelmingly white, according to the latest census data. Slowly though, Latinos have been chipping away at that majority.

""""Anybody in this town is getting undercut by illegal aliens so bad it's hard to make a living anymore,"""" Jack Strapponi said at a tattoo parlor on the main strip in town, getting a blue flower fixed on his arm.

Most of the other businesses on the street are Latino restaurants, storefront churches or hair salons.

Strapponi says illegal immigrants are changing the flavor of the city. They wear their soccer cleats in the park and mess up the lawn.

""""I'm 53 years old and I lived in this town pretty much my whole entire life,"""" Strapponi explained. """"I'm Italian and my great grandparents were immigrants, but they came over here legally. They learned how to speak English.""""

Strapponi says the town started to change as soon as all the Ecuadorians moved in — though it's not clear when that shift began and how many Ecuadorians call Milford home these days.

""""I know that sounds racist, but it's not,"""" Strapponi said. """"It's like they just took up all the jobs.""""

He says the accident that killed Matthew Denice struck a raw nerve.

""""There's been such an influx of illegal aliens in this town, you know, people are finally just fed up,"""" he said.

But there also seems to be a generational difference. Around town, younger folks who went to high school with Denice seem to adopt a more nuanced attitude.

Kane Rogers is the tattoo artist who was working on Strapponi's arm.

""""If that guy hit him, and hit him on the bike, it's one thing that he had no license and was driving drunk, that was the main thing,"""" Rogers said. """"The fact that he came from somewhere, it sucks that that has to be grouped in.""""

Rogers says he doesn't understand why the hit-and-run has become a rallying cry against immigrants. These days, it's such a part of the town folklore that even new immigrants, like Lorana Hernandez, who moved to Milford last year, know all about the accident.

She says she's sometimes scared when she walks around with her da

n the five years since an unlicensed illegal immigrant ran down his son, Don Rosenberg has turned his anger and grief into a mission to answer a seemingly simple question: How many people are killed each year by drivers who don’t belong in the U.S., much less behind a wheel?

Drew Rosenberg, a 25-year-old student at Golden Gate University, was riding his motorcycle in San Francisco when Roberto Galo struck him on Nov. 16, 2010. In his frenzied effort to flee the scene, Galo ran over his victim twice. The elder Rosenberg got the news no parent should hear from San Francisco General Hospital that night, but what he would learn over the next few years only compounded his bitterness.

As many as 7,500 Americans -- 20 per day -- are killed annually by unlicensed drivers, and Rosenberg calculates that more than half are the victims of illegal immigrants. Now, by testifying before lawmakers, speaking to parents who have been through the same ordeal and posting his research on his nonprofit’s website, unlicensedtodrive.org, Rosenberg is shedding light on a frightening number not readily available from government sources.

He worked for the Harrisonburg Votes which is affiliated with the Democratic party. His job was to walk around and get people registered to vote - registering people with any political affiliation not just registering democrats. No where on any article, including the statement from the Justice Dept. website, does anyone say which party he registered anyone with. 

He said he did it because he was worried he wasn't going to meet the registration quota that was set for him. His motivation had nothing to do with politics, it was a kid cheating on his job to meet a quota so he wouldn't look bad.

No voter fraud happened, it was all caught and investigated before they were submitted to the registrars office, so none of the forms even made it to being registered.

His charges aren't related to voter fraud but to falsifying the information on the documents.

He's serving 100-120 days in jail.

We hope you stop by and check out our community!

#1. You have almost 10,000 users and your sub was trending recently, all before Donald Trump was even sworn in as president. To what do you credit the attraction to the sub?

We have been thrilled with the level of interest we've already had. We don't think there would be any interest this early in an impeachment sub if any other candidate--democrat, republican, or """"third"""" party--had won. This is beyond just not liking his politics. Trump is extraordinarily different in his lack of qualification, lack of understanding of the role, and lack of temperamental suitability. As the president is relatively unconstrained in his use of nuclear weapons and in foreign affairs, many people find this especially worrying. To us, the interest is validating the belief that this impeachment talk is not just typical partisanship.

#2. Why should we begin a new chapter of America with a campaign to impeach the president before we give him a chance to be a good president?

We care a great deal about the constitution and the people, so, of course, our first choice would always be a successful Trump. With that said, he repeatedly demonstrated during the campaign and transition that he's unfit for the presidency. We have studied him closely, as many American's did during the election, and we think he will continue his previous patterns of discrimination, breaking the law, and putting his own interests first. We wish that wasn’t the case, but we can’t help but believe that impeachment is going to be a very important topic over the next 4 years whether we like it or not.

#3. Why impeach? Why not start preparations for state and federal offices in 2020?

We think those are great causes, too, and certainly not incompatible with our focus. We definitely encourage you to get involved in local elections for 2018 as well as 2020.

#4. Do you expect that Donald Trump will be impeached before 2020? And if so, what for? What do you think he's guilty of that rises to the level of impeachment? How also do you see it happening given that the House and Senate are GOP controlled?

We think he has already committed impeachable offenses (e.g. bribery), and there is no rule against being impeached for action taken before being sworn in.  [Check out our full arguments for his impeachment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Impeach_Trump/wiki/arguments).  We think it is possible even though there is a republican majority house and senate because many republicans openly dislike Trump and would prefer a President Pence, who would likely help the GOP politically and financially more than Trump.  Although Nixon resigned, he was impeached by his own party, so similar things have happened before.

#5. Trump is impeached. What then? Mike Pence is sworn in. Many might say his fundamentalist Christian views make him even worse than Trump. Does the impeach Pence campaign then begin?

Political differences are not grounds for impeachment, so, ***absolutely not***, we would not support efforts to impeach Pence.  We do not support the impeachment of Trump lightly, as it would be bad for democracy to automatically jump to impeachment talk any time a politician you don’t like wins.  We may not like Pence, but he acts within the bounds of the constitution.",,existenjoy,24,t3_5owf8a,dcmmeiz,t3_5owf8a,t5_2sgno,1484835924
