"US needs to up the rhetoric, especially regarding our nuclear first-strike capability against Russia and willingness to sustain the loss of several minor cities in order to ensure the principles of nuclear non-proliferation remain intact.

The endgame on this is that severe for the US, and the world, and I do not know that it has been properly articulated to Russia.

If we do not defend a nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity after they have conceded their nuclear weapons, then we have no capability to ensure or induce nuclear non-proliferation in the future.

This leads to a world where all nation's have nuclear weapons, because not having them is to be at constant risk of annexation or partial invasion.

In this multi-polar world, the US cannot survive a multidirectional strike and is more likely to become the victim of nuclear terrorism on a major scale.

From a basic, rational perspective, it is advisable to use our current power asymmetry to defend current norms, or to eliminate all threat (present and future) by launching an absolutely crippling and unprecedented first strike, and absorbing the minimal casualties which would result from a minor Russian response.

Russian TV has begun using the rhetoric about being able to lay the US to radioactive waste— it is time for US to at least get to that level, even if it is not our President issuing the threat; though I believe a statement of commitment coming from out National Command Authority would be far more persuasive.

Frankly, the optimal move might even not be to issue a warning, but at a certain point simply initiate a first-strike protocol against Russia, targeting all of their roughly 200 silo'd assets, destroying their nuclear missile subs (the one at sea and the rest at port), their strategic long range bombers, and their mobile launchers. We might miss half of their mobile launchers, but those missiles are non-MIRV'd and therefore of less risk. Additionally, they are less likely to be subject to dead hand protocols, and might be under local command authorities who would hesitate or decline to fire. Finally, we do have a limited missile defense regime through the use of Ground Based Mid-Course Defense, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, Airborne Lasers, and AEGIS missile systems which have a functional ceiling of about 94 km.

If anything, we would be forced to let 10-20 missiles through targeting low priority, hopefully military, installations. That said we might lose Baltimore, Boston, Minneapolis or Chicago. All of which are expendable.

That said, we would effectively destroy Russia permanently, and China would be all too happy to emerge stronger, and stay out of the conflict.

From a Nation State perspective, the logic is clear, and it worries me that Obama is not making this logic clear to Putin, or that Obama is letting his humanity and dovishness get in the way of making the right choice.

The U.S. public position should be that under no circumstances will Russia get Crimea, including, if necessary, the complete deployment of our entire strategic nuclear force. End of story.",t1_cg53674,-6,t3_20myzo,cg53674,t3_20myzo,t5_2qh13,Error!
"I found this statement funny.

&gt; Klitschko reiterated that the March 16 referendum in Crimea was conducted illegally, and that the peninsula remains “part and parcel” of Ukraine. As such, the Ukrainian government will continue to provide services to Crimea, including electricity, gas, and water. 

Now it is far more legal than the power grab the interim government used to take government. 

Also I don't understand how throwing money at military spending, when your country is bordering on economic crisis, is a smart idea. Make no mistake people, the acting government is making policy choices they have no mandate to do. And if people on this web site viewed it critically, they would have big issue with right-wing nationalists running the nation on the back of a coup.

"For those who are confused. Ukraine is in a revolution because the former government was leaning towards Russia. The majority of the people however wanted a more European-focused future. Hence revolt in Kiev. Suddenly unidentified troops show up in Crimea, we all know they are russian, but they wear no sign (or flag). 

Crimea would suddenly like to vote for independance, writes out a ballot. Only etnic and pro-Russians vote. 97% voted yes for independance. (This whole vote was unconstitutional and thus illegal) Not one country will confirm these results. Only Syria has proclaimed support for russia. Which is even worse than no countries in my opinion.

Now the crimean government (who voted for attachment to Russia unanimously) wants the Ukrainian army out of it's supposed territory. 

Analysed this is pretty ingenious. Have a puppet government declare independance and then attachment, put a deadline on the retreat of the original and only lawful presence of Ukrainian army. And voilà you have a Casus Belli. Because of course they will protect their lawful borders.

I thought the majority of the vote in Crimea was to become a part of Russia. At this point doesn't that mean this is Ukraine's fault?
