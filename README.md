# RedditTrollingDetection
- We use IBM Watson emotion classification API to generate a vector of emotions for each Reddit comment and use machine learning algorithms to predict whether a post is trolling or not.
- Below are links to accessing the reddit database from kaggle, which is 32GB.
- If you are using mac os, these are the posts I used to access the database named database.sqlite once you extract the db from the 7z folder.
