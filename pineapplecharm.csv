If the Titanic had hit that iceberg head-on, instead of letting it gouge its way down multiple sections, she might well have stayed afloat long enough to be safely evacuated.

According to the link posted by /u/astalavista114 the Britannic might even have survived the mine:

&gt; The ... crucial bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four and its door were undamaged and should have guaranteed the ship's survival. However, there were open portholes along the lower decks... As the ship's list increased, water reached this level and began entering aft from the bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four. With more than six compartments flooded, Britannic could not stay afloat.

So actually the critical weakness of *Britannic* wasn't explosives but over-enthusiastic medical staff.

You can see why they thought the design was worthy of the ""unsinkable"" moniker; most other boats would just sink as soon as there was a single hole anywhere in the hull allowing more water in than could be pumped out.

"""The position doesn't matter"" - this is really important.  If you were using a 100% efficient motor and also using it as a 100% efficient regenerative braking system AND there was no friction or air resistance then your net energy loss from the battery would be zero.  Merely moving from point A to point B does not consume energy; only changing the velocity (i.e. speed or direction) or pulling away from a gravitaional or electromagnetic force costs energy.  Ferdinand is spot on (although I would have said 'altitude' rather than 'height' - deforming the car is a whole other problem).

It's only because our world is full of friction, air resistance and other inefficiencies that this is counterintuitive.  The implications are huge; a long space flight for example only requires, in theory, a big push at the beginning.  You'd then drift in a straight line for as long as you liked without burning any more fuel until something happened to slow you down or change your direction.

Also, somewhat depressingly, it means that when you cruise at a constant speed on the motorway, pretty much all of your gas is being burnt up just to move some air out of the way of your car.",t1_c03qo7t,3,t1_c03qn2r,c03qo7t,t3_6g1fw,t5_mouw

Obviously the watch does still have *some* memory so you should find that recently used watchfaces and apps persist.  One solution to your specific issue is to make sure you load the game last thing before going out of range of the phone.

It's kind of funny how this is now a problem; before the change everyone whined that 8 slots wasn't enough.

I mean, I loved this game and I quite enjoyed The Cardigans' album of, incidentally, the same name as the game (bet somebody got $20,000 for that little bit of searching) but ""Hell yes""?  Let me give you the red pill.

There is another game intro which begins not with cars but with trees, wafting gently in the pre-dawn breeze. You can hear the leaves rustle. You feel calm. Cross fade to a slow drift along a metalled road verge, vaguely reminiscent of the view when you looked down as seven years old while running home from school to play your brand new console.  A leaf is racing you.  But you're winning.  In the background you suddenly notice there is music, except it's not music yet.  It's more like the dischordant, faint scent of music like when you're still two blocks from some big concert and one of the support acts are already rocking it.  Something big is coming.  Racing signals, dormant.  Promise of the starting grid. They flick on; the first bright colour. You can feel it now. The stands, vacant, waiting for the roaring crowd, the dawn mist parting, drifting away, revealing an impossibly wide expanse of track.  A trailer gate is opening - what kind of car is that? The unloading lift jolts and you catch a glimpse of a wheel arch twitching as it lands. *What kind of car IS that?* A sharp bend, the grid, the pit.. and all the time that music is building, now with a beat; your heart is synchronising with it, your hands are getting twitchy and you feel tense.

Flags are up, reaching up into a clear blue sky and finally, after a whole minute, you see a car properly as it swings out for a warm up.  *Come on!* Some road writing.. it becomes Sony.. Sony Entertainment Presents... Oh shit, here it comes; the music is twitching, teasing, winding you up further.  A dogleg turn, a night city scene, the logos come raining down *yes, yes, let's go* and the slogan you've seen on a million billboards punches up with a sound that could be a typewriter or a machine gun or flickering engine valves THE REAL DRIVING SIMULATOR.

Then you're in a tunnel but you're going backwards, winding up, winding up, pulling back like that clockwork car you had when you were three.  Then a blaze of red and blue, tumbling through space and slamming into place.  The music is screaming now.  What does it say? *What does it say, motherfucker?*

Common misconception.  There's no heat required - you're thinking of jerky.  Biltong is simply air-dried; the bulb is there to cause convection and circulate the air up and out of the box.  It also has a mild drying effect on the air but it's definitely not a cooking process.  If the air is already fairly dry then a case fan will pull fresh air past about 1.5kg of meat just fast enough to avoid mould having a chance to grow.,t1_cley55s,1,t1_clesz9p,cley55s,t3_2jr53l,t5_2qh55

Its sprawling suburbia just North of the Bath Road is uneventful.  There aren't many things to do, of course, because the town centre is a ghost town but if you're out for a nice evening then Windsor is one stop by train and a (max) £15 late cab home.

Honestly, having lived in Windsor, I'd recommend Slough.  So much quieter (seriously, plane noise in Windsor is awful) and you'll actually get something for your money, too.  At age 30 you'll appreciate that more than being a ten minute walk from the nightclubs.

Despite being no more than collie sized, he once knocked a 6 foot German backpacker to his feet and stood on his chest snarling.  Total badass.

Anyway, one fine day I failed to notice him burrowing under the fence.  Next thing he got into a cow field and decided it was top sport to nip them on the legs and make them run about.  Understandably, he got kicked in the head.  Amazingly, he survived.  Not without injury though; he was missing a bunch of skin from the side of his face.  I took him to the vet who knocked him out, amputated his ear and put in a few stitches.

We went back a week later to have the stitches out.  Bob the badass hid on the parcel shelf of the car.  Then he snuck past three of us and had to be chased down in the vet's garden.  Finally I caught him and my flatmate and I (yes two of us) held him down while the vet whipped out the stitches.

He never cried or whimpered but, while we were holding him, he pissed himself. :o(

"I used to be an ""English language consultant"" at the Times.  It was awesome.  Some choice excerpts I saved for posterity:

Officers, trying to arrest an unlicensed pub landlord, get beer poured on them by angry patrons:
*In mitigation the four all pleaded for leniency claming that they were dead drunk on the day in question and that they never meant to do what they did.*

And then, the next day.. 
*A sheeben King at Logoba did the unthinkable yesterday when he said that he would pay the E400 fine for his patrons who were arrested for spilling umcombotsi over three police officers, as they are his bonafide patrons at his sheebeen.*

Sometimes, tautology is just the way to go: 
*Justice Masuku said he was shot and killed by the use of a firearm*

Old man found harbouring prostitutes..
*“I am sometimes tempted to sleep with them but because I have self esteem and my senses are all functioning I desist from doing such a thing which might invite trouble for me,” he said.*

The unluckiest man in the whole world.. 
*The Mbatha family has 12 children and all are girls. It has been gathered that the father could not give up without his wife giving birth to a boy. However that invited him trouble as he is now faced with the enormous task of raising all 12. He blames himself for all the trouble he has created for his family.
*

Moaning about freedom of speech, one article called for repeal of the Official Secrete Act while another told readers about a charity walk that begins from the Prince of Whales stadium. 

This belongs in the Guardian! Lawyer evades liability by claiming he wasn’t a partner..
*The CJ said such a belated revelation cannot affect his liability to third parties as clients dealt with the firm on the basis of Thembela being one of its constituent partners.
He said Thembela’s conduct recalls to mind the idiomatic description of the conduct of rodent passengers on a floundering vessel.*

Sounds just like the UK..
*MANZINI – What was meant to be a culture competition for Manzini region schools turned out to be a culture and alcohol-drinking competition as some students drank until they forgot their names at the Salesian Sports grounds yesterday here.

"I've heard this story over and over.

I know they aren't interested in the business and I accept that their first priority is the child.  But that doesn't make it any easier on the business owner.

Would you take on somebody if you seriously thought this was going to happen?  Would any small enterprise ever hire anyone?  Equality is a nice idea but it will stifle small and slow growing businesses to the point where the only way to get started will be to take a big loan.  And that is not in the interests of the economy at large.

There should be a second class of job, which you as a company have to fulfill certain requirements to offer.  Low turnover (not profit) for example, maybe under 5 employees too.  Basically, a company with little reserve with which to deal with an uncertain absence of a large percentage of its workforce.  This second class job should carry with it either a waiver on the sexism discrimination policy (although this is completely insane and unfair to women who aren't interested in babies), a waiver on the ability to dismiss people for falling pregnant (which we kind of have in the UK given that in theory there's no unfair dismissal if it's in the first two years, although woe betide anyone who tries this out and immediately hires a man) or - and here's a wacky fucking idea - *some kind of increased government support in the case of pregnancy*.

That second comma is by any measure redundant.  In the UK version (I just went to check) it is missing.

&gt; He flicked it open, held it up in the air and clicked it.

Edit: sometimes it's there because you're using commas like parentheses, to insert a side piece of information.  e.g. ""I went to the shops, as I often do, and then came home.""  In the example I quoted this isn't what's going on since the three clauses are a direct sequence with the same subject and object.

"It is more expensive to produce: takes longer and requires more malt to feed to the yeast.  But more significantly, there's more duty to pay.

&gt; **Beer Duty rates**
&gt; Most beers are charged General Beer Duty at £19.12 per hectolitre % of alcohol. For example, if you release a batch of 5 hectolitres of beer of a strength 4.0% ABV, your Beer Duty liability would be £382.40 (£19.12 × 5 × 4.0).
&gt; 
&gt; **High strength beer**
&gt; High Strength Beer Duty is charged on beer that exceeds 7.5% ABV and this is in addition to the General Beer Duty. This additional charge is set at £5.09. For example, if you release a batch of 5 hectolitres of beer of a strength 8.0% ABV, your Beer Duty liability is £968.40:
&gt; 
&gt; General Beer Duty - £19.12 × 5 × 8 = £764.80
&gt; 
&gt; High Strength Beer Duty - £5.09 × 5 × 8 = £203.60
&gt; 
&gt; **Lower strength beer**
&gt; Lower strength beer which is more than 1.2% ABV but not more than 2.8% ABV is set at £9.17. For example, if you release a batch of 5 hectolitres of beer of a strength 2.8% ABV, your Beer Duty liability will be £128.38:
&gt; 
&gt; Lower Strength Beer Duty - £9.17 × 5 × 2.8 = £128.38

One day they said, ""why don't you take the kids to the park"" so he got them up, fed and dressed to go out.  At the last minute ""the producer rang"" and the crew said they should now get some playing-at-home footage instead.  So boots and coats came off, kids started playing a game... and another call came through saying they had to come to the park now.  So the kids are totally confused, frustrated, screaming... and at that exact moment the cameras came out to show what off my mate's terrible parenting skills.

"I'm also British and [I did this in 2005](http://pineapplecharm.co.uk/trip/index.php?map=1).  About a month before I left I posted a website showing my route so random Internet people could let me know if I was passing by their house so we could hang out.  In 4 weeks I was only on my own one night (Toronto; awesome, friendly town so it didn't matter) and I met a bunch of cool people, including some top artists from [Worth1000](http://worth1000.com), Rob from [Cockeyed](http://cockeyed.com) and T-Bone from [Boneland](http://boneland.com)/[Minushi](http://minushi.com).

I went to a mormon homecoming dance in Utah, was schooled in English pronunciation by a four year-old in Illinois, got mosquito-bitten to shit trying to barbecue in a canyon in Texas and attended a stag party with guys I'd never met before in San Francisco.  It was easily the best month I've had since entering full time employment.  I did start writing it all down in my spare time but after a year I flaked out at the Sacramento chapter.  I should finish it.

I also recorded time lapse of every leg with a Windows98 laptop and a web cam on the dashboard which worked surprisingly well, though it makes for stultifying viewing!  Here's a [sample](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBM5z8dNENw).

"&gt; Things change

I agree, but part of the problem is people accepting having the goalposts moved and blaming themselves for not being informed.  Obviously it's a sliding scale - your mother getting left behind isn't the industry's fault - but this is very much something that I felt I knew about which has changed in a big way without my attention being drawn to it.  Much as I loved poring over every detail of new cellphones in the past I really don't have time for it so much any more.

Part of what instructs the way I spend my money is how much trust I can place in my suppliers to do things of which I approve, so I don't have to waste my time reading up on functions I didn't want in the first place, because they're enabled by default and to my mind are now a security risk.

"It's a funny one.  I was glad to see them go, but this thread makes me want to be allowed to do as you suggested.  Funny how perspective works innit.

&gt;Rather an amusing thing happened while dressing that morning.  I was very cold when I got back into the boat, and, in my hurry to get my shirt on, I accidentally jerked it into the water.  It made me awfully wild, especially as George burst out laughing.  I could not see anything to laugh at, and I told George so, and he only laughed the more.  I never saw a man laugh so much.
&gt;
&gt;I quite lost my temper with him at last, and I pointed out to him what a drivelling maniac of an imbecile idiot he was; but he only roared the louder.  And then, just as I was landing the shirt, I noticed that it was not my shirt at all, but George’s, which I had mistaken for mine; whereupon the humour of the thing struck me for the first time, and I began to laugh.  And the more I looked from George’s wet shirt to George, roaring with laughter, the more I was amused, and I laughed so much that I had to let the shirt fall back into the water again.
&gt;
&gt;“Ar’n’t you—you—going to get it out?” said George, between his shrieks.
&gt;
&gt;I could not answer him at all for a while, I was laughing so, but, at last, between my peals I managed to jerk out:
&gt;
&gt;“It isn’t my shirt—it’s yours!”
&gt;
&gt;I never saw a man’s face change from lively to severe so suddenly in all my life before.
&gt;
&gt;“What!” he yelled, springing up.  “You silly cuckoo!  Why can’t you be more careful what you’re doing?  Why the deuce don’t you go and dress on the bank?  You’re not fit to be in a boat, you’re not.  Gimme the hitcher.”
&gt;
&gt;I tried to make him see the fun of the thing, but he could not.  George is very dense at seeing a joke sometimes.

"In most developed countries the line would be ""do everything you can to avoid an accident"" and the matter of whether hitting someone saved other more numerous lives would be left for courts to decide in individual cases.  Additionally, in Europe in particular, strict vehicle inspection and seatbelt law means that swerving would not be a terrible risk for the passengers of most vehicles.  However in most of Africa, vehicles are often in a poor state of repair with bald tyres, shot shocks and the like, as well as being regularly overloaded with unsecured passengers, which makes anything other than straight-line progress highly risky.

High speed roads are also better isolated from pedestrian traffic - I've *never* seen livestock or people (except those who have pulled over) on the motorway in Europe but I've seen cows, horses and drunken pedestrians stumbling into the path of 70mph traffic many times in countries south of the Med.

While it is of course possible to dream up a situation where this sort of decision might have to happen on the Autobahn, I think it's much more an edge case than in rural Africa, as evidenced by the lack of *exhortation to commit deliberate manslaughter* in the government-issued driving instruction literature, certainly here in the UK.

"The problem I have with it is you act like ""I'm a late one"" is somehow a charming character trait, like being funny or having red hair.  It's not.  It's something we all do occasionally and *every time* someone isn't late it's because they *chose not to be late*.

Let's say you arrange to meet your mate at 7pm and you know it takes about half an hour to get there.  If you aim to leave the house at 6:30 you are already late.  Seriously, it's two days before and you've already made the decisions that will lead to you being late.  Because if you reach a natural break in what you're doing come 6:15 you won't leave the house and be early, you'll start some other horseshit task, and come 6:35 you'll still be looking for your fucking shoes instead of being on the bus already.  And then you're late, and your mate who did leave at 6:15 is sat there reading the adverts on the tube platform, or defending his solo occupancy of a table in a crowded pub, until your sweaty, stressed-out self shows up.

Being late is a form of selfishness; it's rude not to value others' scheduled time over your flexible time.  When you refuse to run the risk of being early, because you can totally just squeeze in something before you leave, you're guaranteeing you will always be late.

I was like you for a long time, constantly making up bullshit excuses and exaggerating about the District Line not showing up, all because I couldn't even entertain the thought of standing around waiting for someone else like a loser.  Carrying a Kindle helped me a lot; I would look forward to being ten or fifteen minutes early to things because I'd get to read my book for a bit.  And not being ""a late one"" changes your life; it's incredibly liberating when the tube is delayed on the way to something important and you can relax about it and consider your options instead of being torn apart by miserable self loathing.

You also get to hear what everyone says about late people before they show up.",,4,t1_d4sidqy,d4skj8d,t3_4qdssr,t5_2qhqb

Still got a cab back to Earls Court though, the lazy swine.  And he sold ""The Time Traveller's Wife"" to my main competitor.  Sigh.

Probably not before its time, but it was a real gem.

Mostly the messing about was limited to the lower boards; the fear of a painful flat-landing from the top two or three levels was enough to keep us from experimenting much beyond a straight jump.

One afternoon when was about 14, my buds and I were chilling on the grass when some older (like, 18 year-old) guys showed up.  One of them calmly climbed to the top board and stood on the edge facing backwards.  Then he just leaned back, rigid, and tipped gently, gently, turning in the air like a tumbling pin as he fell and entered the water perfectly vertical.

* Come to rely on it so much you never take your phone out of your pocket any more

* Forget what your ringtone ever sounded like and, on the one day when you let the battery die, not recognise said ringtone as yours so it goes on and on for the full 30 seconds, delighting everyone around you

* Show it to your friends and explain it's not an Apple Watch

* Show it to your other friends and explain it's not Android Wear compatible

* Show it to your one remaining friend who really likes watches and admit that, yes, charging your watch every week is still pretty nuts when you're used to one of those kinetic ones that you never have to charge

* Suddenly notice it isn't relaying notifications because your phone auto-updated to a version of iOS/Android that no longer supports Pebble

* Waste 50 hours or more over a month down- and side-grading your phone before finally settling on an untested beta version which doesn't quite work properly with anything else but at least your Pebble still runs

* Let your girlfriend's 4 year-old fiddle with it and then later get in trouble for ""ignoring"" her because the daughter put it in Quiet Mode without you noticing

* Work out that the countdown timer will keep vibrating pretty much indefinitely once it goes off, and then spend way too much time in bed trying to synchronise the countdown perfectly

* Realise how gross this is and feel grateful the Pebble is waterproof and can be thoroughly washed

* Discover that while Strava still just about works, if it gets interrupted by a notification it doesn't reliably come back and isn't in the app menu

* Resent everyone who tries to contact you while you're exercising

* Boast about how you can reply to texts with voice, which isn't really texting and driving

* Nearly crash your car because on the fifth attempt the watch still thinks you're saying, ""I'll be home Dirk Gently"" instead of ""I'll be home directly"" and your rage is so intense you can't even see straight

* Swap the straps for fun silicone ones",,55,t3_6s39s0,dl9zkp2,t3_6s39s0,t5_2txls

			curtop += obj.offsetTop;
		} while (obj = obj.offsetParent);

and then track the cursor every few hundred ms with something like

		var posy = 0;
		if (!e) var e = window.event;
		if (e.pageX || e.pageY) 	{

firing based on whether it's over one of them.

"&gt; The people that I manage to hang out with, are all seem so busy like they're running for the presidency

It's not a good start to be dismissive of others' lives.  Your complaint that people are friendly to your face and then don't want to meet up later suggests that they don't value time with you over other things in their lives and this is your problem to fix, not theirs.  Do you check in and ask after things that are going on in their lives, even when you aren't trying to meet up?  In other words, are you actually just trying to fix your loneliness, rather than making an effort to give friendship to others?

Have you read [How to win friends and influence people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People)? I've known very few people who were really good at making friends and *to a (wo)man* they did it by taking a sincere interest in others without expecting anything in return.  It's easy to think people will gravitate towards super cool, interesting guys with crazy stories but the truth is, as Dale Carnegie says, ""the sweetest sound to a man's ears is the sound of his own name"".  People don't want to get to know you, they want to talk about what interests them.  Sounds selfish?  Well so does this:

&gt; it's tedious having to go through all the introduction phase countless of times knowing I'd probably never see them again.

If you don't want to waste your time on the 'tedium' of chatting to new people without the payoff of their becoming your friend then you're destined for disappointment.  That process, meeting new people over and over, is most of the social interaction you will be getting for a while.

"Honestly, I know where you're going with this but it sounds like a massive drama bomb waiting to go off.

Here's the issue: ""If they reply yes"" is going to be your biggest hurdle, since an affirmative reply could be anything from ""Dude, I'm in so much trouble, seriously"" to ""You need to get home NOW!!"".  The normal way to get around this will make you sound like a robot (because Tasker is one) and nobody in a genuine emergency is going to appreciate ""Text YES if this is an emergency"", particularly the first time they get it (when they'll think you're being rude) and the fifth time they get it when it's not an emergency (when they'll get the hump with you for automating your relationship).

Personally, I would simply set Tasker to bump out of silent mode after three calls and, if anyone abuses it, gently suggest they calm down in future.

On a similar note, a smartwatch can really help with monitoring phone calls without disturbing anyone around you.

To answer your question, you can set variables that persist from one event to another, so you can set %MISSEDNUM to a number once you've missed a call, and then see if it's the same number the next time the phone rings.  If you set another variable to the time of the call, and increment a third variable if the same number calls within a certain timespan, you can have a task go off when %ConsecutiveSameNumberMissedWithinFiveMinutes gets up to 3.  You'll figure it out.",,4,t3_4kn96y,d3g7muk,t3_4kn96y,t5_2s0ro

They have actively campaigned to make water not a human right, as an excuse for drilling ground water out from under rural communities, to the point that the water table will likely never recover. So entire communities get to starve to death over the next few years but it's okay because a different ""arm"" actually sells the water to you.

"They will definitely provide toast, newspapers, confetti etc, probably in exchange for a small fee.  Further, I was thrown out once for bringing a prop.

Full story: in 1997 I went to the RHPS *every* Friday night for about two months.  It was ridiculous but in my defence the show used to be amazing; each scene on screen was acted out very enthusiastically by real live people on the stage and if you were in the front row you'd get water / underwear / lab coats on you as a matter of course.  During *There's a Light* they would encourage people to unfold the newspaper from their prop pack to shelter from the staff squirting everyone with water pistols from the balcony.

Anyway, one night I went with rowdy school friends and decided to up the ante.  I wore my best drag outfit and a huge overcoat, underneath which was my little sister's full-on Super Soaker.  Pumping with adrenaline, I smuggled that thing right into the auditorium and, just as Brad and Janet were getting their bedraggledest, I leaped up out of my seat, pumped my weapon and let fly with a full on crowd-control water cannon barrage.

Unfortunately, in my drunken enthusiasm I had failed to inspect the balcony carefully and my ebullient hosing hit their high powered spotlight, causing a small cloud of steam and a distinct dimming of the light as the lens cracked.  Within seconds the ushers had rushed me, divested me of my sister's gun and escorted me from the auditorium.  Barely ten minutes into the film I found myself deposited back into Leicester Square alone, unarmed and in full Anne Summers style drag.

I waited about fifteen minutes before, realising my friends weren't coming, sloping off for a pint.  I'd love to say I was the centre of attention but when a skinny boy in a suspender belt orders a pint of Guinness at the Moon Under Water you'd be surprised at how wide a berth he gets.

"Funny, I was thinking to post a similar thread today because I just ditched my PTS.

I had a 1st-gen PS and always loved it.  Never having my phone off silent is amazing, replying briefly from my wrist spectacular and  not being able to get directions while cycling in the rain from my phone buried snugly in my jacket is now unthinkable.  The killer, though, the best thing, is the screen.  When it's static it looks so crisp, bright and sharp that it looks like it was custom carved by hand.  And then it changes!  Magical.

Of course when PT came along I had to have one, and bagged a kickstarter edition without hesitating.  I have to tell you, out of the box it was astonishing.  The colours are bright (in daylight) and a total revelation compared to the monochrome dowdiness of the original PS.  Also, the upgrade from 4 to 7 days' battery life is legit; you really can just charge it at weekends.  The lack of restrictions on apps is also less restricting.  You'd be amazed how quickly you get through eight slots if you're like me and love a gimmicky watchface (or seven) but also need a few useful apps and of course Pebtris for when the phone's battery dies.  Oh yeah, and did I mention the dictation?  Impresses the shit out of everyone.

So far so good, and I've had the PTS on my wrist for, what, five months now.  I noticed my old charging cable in the office a few days ago and just for fun I dug out the old PS and tried it on.

FUCK A DOODLE DO.  I had become blind to what a beast the PTS is.  The old PS may not have the battery life but it's about half the weight (office postal scales say 85g vs 142g). Switching back was a noticeable relief.  And the screen, Jesus.  The colour on PTS wows you the first few times you wear it but now that I'm used to it there's a noticeable jump up in clarity and contrast going back to PS.  PTS is pretty crap in the dark, actually; the colours are really washed out and the contrast, and viewing angles, aren't great.  PS on the other hand looks great 24/7 and from every angle.  In sunlight it looks like laser print on paper and I love it.

So to recap the perceived advantages of PTS in the order I mentioned them: 4 days' battery life is actually fine.  Cable at the office instead of home means a quick charge on Friday and Monday keeps me going with no worries.  App restrictions are also no stress really; you just have to admit you're never actually going to use seventeen different gimmicky faces every day. And the voice recognition?  When it works it's great but if your data connection is poor or you're somewhere noisy or echoey then it's probably better just to get your phone out.  If I think about all the times I've re-recorded myself ten times and nearly crashed my bike, I bet it would have taken less time to stop and type.

In short, despite the battery life PTS is heavy, despite having colour the display isn't as satisfying to look at and despite the microphone and unlimited app slots it isn't that much more useful.

Two final points: I had PS longer but the PTS screen got more scratched.  Sample size of one in each case but it's noticeable to me.  Also, might be because the watch weighs less but the vibration on PS is much stronger.  Occasionally I would miss PTS notifications but on PS my teeth jangle.

It's only the opinion of one man but I say save your money and get a deal on a PS with a strap you really like.",,5,t3_43r780,czl1arm,t3_43r780,t5_2txls

If you have kids at a local school you'll be much twitchier about a miserable goth kid looking to buy .  But if you're childless then you might not think much of it because it doesn't affect you directly.  The threat of a conviction might just make you a bit more invested in a good outcome from the sale and make you more careful.

Those of us who work with potentially dangerous goods or people have to take some of the responsibility for reducing the danger.  Cool off periods and background checks are great but they're also box-ticking which I'm sure some unscrupulous retailers treat as an annoyance rather than a useful tool to help make society safer.  If they were perceived not as anti-business bureaucracy but as a tool to keep the gun dealer himself out of prison then they might be more effective.

In Australia, if you stumble drunk out of a bar and into the path of a car, *the bartender who last served you is partly liable*, because he had the chance to prevent you getting too wrecked to get home safely.  A mate of mine worked in a Sydney bar and he said that if a ""bucks night"" (stag party) came in and even one of them acted too drunk, he'd bar them and then call every bar on the street to make sure they didn't accidentally serve the group either.

And if you don't think that sounds like an excellent idea then you're probably from ""live free or die"" New Hampshire, which is basically too rich to give a shit about how society actually functions.  MUH PRINCIPLES!",,-3,t1_d4bd4mb,d4be60x,t3_4o9frb,t5_2cneq

"I think a lot of the reason for its popularity with teenagers is that they can relate to the characters' helplessness. They exist in a world that cares little for them,  that has unfathomable rules and makes little sense, that is at once terrifying and cruel while also oddly benevolent and full of opportunity, albeit often just out of reach. The poacher who is mean but generous, the uncle who is generous but demanding, the career that brings grinding failure and sudden success - these are all hallmarks of the hapless teenage experience.

As you get older however most of us move out of this world. We make our own luck, and instead of farcical escapades we experience achievement and progress. We maintain our cars, we plan our meals ahead, we don't get drunk during the day just because we have £20 to burn and pick fights with strangers. On the one hand we don't find ourselves cowering in bed expecting to be murdered but on the other we generate fewer completely insane anecdotes.

Edit: [found the original](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ipgrk/iama_combat_vet_who_has_lived_the_horrors_of_war/c25n8jj/) - the context, if possible, makes it even better.

&gt;I once ate a tray of 24 assorted muffins: blueberry, lemon poppy-seed, cranberry apple, banana nut, even bran. Large muffins too, like you'd buy at the bakery, not grocery store mini-muffins. I ate the first five or six out of hunger, and the next dozen I can only attribute to gluttony, but the last half dozen were devoured by determination alone. A part of me wanted to stop - I was full, the muffins had become repulsive, and there was a disconcerting pressure in my chest. The other, stronger part of me knew that if I gave up on that muffin platter I would admit limitation. A limited man can rationalize his every weakness, turn away from every challenge, live his life within the narrow confines of comfort; that's not how I live my life. But I digress. It took six days for my bowels to move, and when they did I shat a monolithic muffin block so wide it could not be flushed, so dense it would not dissolve with repeated flushing, and so heavy it took two hands to lift.

"There are many theories but the most convincing one for me revolves around happenstance.  In the 1960's Britain was going through an awful period; a weak government was being pushed around by the unions, industry was slowing and North Sea Oil hadn't turned up yet to bolster the economy.  Some people were still rich but the majority of people really weren't so restaurant meals were an impossible luxury.  The market segregated into The Ritz at one end, the corner greasy spoon fry-up house on the other and little in between.

Enter entrepreneurial immigrants from India, many of whom had only arrived recently.  Decent food, served in idiosyncratic but classy surroundings by polite waiters - suddenly the void into which a working class young man's date plans had been mired was filled by a sensible option.  Ditto family outings.  Indian restaurants became a favourite mainly because they swamped a huge market that hadn't really existed before.

Now they're the most reliable option among sit-down restaurants that are reliably open late and have become a firm post-pub favourite.

It also doesn't hurt that the food is, largely, pretty good.  Honestly, I have to ask in return what is up with decent curry being so hard to track down in the USA.",t1_c1lm8sl,1,t1_c1llr9c,c1lm8sl,t3_g7rvo,t5_2qh1i

"The main protagonist came across as an idiot to me.  The conversations between him and the computer were stilted, void of content and dull, so I felt no affinity for either of them as characters and didn't believe they fell in love because, well, there was so little with which *to* fall in love.

I felt the technological detail, in particular of the installation, was jarringly unrealistic, which I think wrenched me out of the film's world.  Although I don't recall exactly why now I think it was just plainly obvious that it was inferring too much from too little and generally guilty of the usual Hollywood-science problem where the people writing the screenplay don't think it's important to involve anyone who knows what they're on about.  ""Let's do the installation scene,"" they say, and throw some graphics and slightly cryptic jargon at the audience to patronise them a bit.  It was only one step removed from an eighties montage for all the thought that had gone into it.

It bothered me that this super intelligent AI system didn't figure out what his needs were.  It seemed like a cop out that he had so little self-awareness about the fact that he was just reflecting his own personality back onto himself through a digital filter.  And the ending was simultaneously predictable, and so obvious that it kind of surprised me but in an irritating way, as if they'd deliberately gone for something that didn't tie up any loose ends not because it was whimsical and thought-provoking, but just to piss me off and leave the story with no proper closure.

I know this is all really vague but it was, what, two years ago now?  I know that's ironically annoying and if this was about a film I liked it would seem like a pretty vacuous critique.  I'm tempted to go rent it again just so I can write up a more specific review for you.

In the UK at least I would say the general awareness of paying VAT is way lower than in the States.

"The PTS is huge and, with a metal strap, heavy.  This makes its vibrations less strong than, for example, the original Pebble Steel (far right in the header image on this sub).

The display isn't all that.  Always-on looks a million bucks compared to  Gear or the Apple watch but the viewing angles are restricted and with the backlight the colours are washed out to a disappointing degree.  If you don't have a face with strong contrast it's going to be hard to read after dark.

Oh, and the charging cable interface is TERRIBLE.  On my original Steel I could clip the nice, strong magnet firmly onto the lower left side and it felt secure; I could charge it on my wrist at work or loose on the passenger seat of my car.  The PTS attaches somewhere in the middle of the back, so you can't wear it, and comes free if you look at it funny.  In the car I have to stand it upright, prop it up with a shoe and drive like I have an open container of acid in my lap or else when I get there it's not charged.  Oh yeah and the contacts stick out further than the magnet so once it does come loose it immediately shorts out your charger on the metal case.  WELL DONE PEBBLE.  WELL. DONE.

"While I agree with you in principle, in practice people are stupid and irresponsible and need to pushed in the right direction.  I think there is a big difference between a helmet and a house in Compton.  One of them objectively reduces your burden on society due to drastically reduced chances of head trauma.  The second wouldn't solve anything, it would just displace the trouble elsewhere.

My favourite example of this is motorway ""speed advisories"".  If you stop to think for half a second you'll realise that everybody paying attention to them will not only make traffic smoother but could easily make your journey shorter... yet everyone ignores them and speeds right into the back of the tailback.  However, when they're camera-enforced ""variable limit"" signs, people slow the hell down and, weirdly enough, the traffic tends to flow more smoothly.

I'm not saying the government knows best, just that there's more logic behind ""stupid law""s than merely a desire to oppress the common man.

"I have a car insured with them so when I bought a second car I naturally called.  After all they boast they're *the* multi car specialists.  They wanted £550 for the second car, third party only.  Then they realised they hadn't accounted for a claim that I made two years ago when a TNT driver hit my brother's *parked* car while I happened to be responsible for it.  So the premium went up to £650, which for a limited-mileage classic stank of bullshit.  However, being away from home for a few days I went for it so I was legal and paid the £650 upfront.

When I got home I rang a specialist, got a quote for £200 and rang Admiral back.  Being within the 14 days I was entitled to a full refund.  ""Oh yes Mr Pineapplecharm, I will be refunding you the £345.62...""

""£650,"" I corrected him.  ""I would like a full refund please.""

""Oh but sir the new premium was giving you the discount on your other car also.""

""No, that was paid up through June already, this doesn't affect the first car.  Even if it did, what I want is to go back to the situation I had a week ago and receive a full refund please as is my legal right.""

""No sir you are not understanding me.  You converted to a multi car policy with a multi car discount and now you are losing this the discount, isn't it.""

Long story short, I became irate, asked for the manager, was told he wasn't there, invoked my rights as a customer of a financial services company and told them if I didn't get a refund I would hang up and call the police.  At that point he put me on hold for about 30 seconds after which he gave me my money back.

I am sure this is policy - try to trick people into relinquishing their rights in the hope that they will just back down.  It makes me livid to think of elderly or less assertive people losing money to these dicks just because they don't know their rights or won't stand up for them.

I get what you're saying about honouring great scientists but by the same logic we'd only have economists on bank notes. It's a great opportunity not just to honour a great person but to reference something recognisable from popular culture. When I were a lad my junior school named the years/grades after a different theme each academic year. Famous architects,  or geological eras for example. At the time they were just words but when I came across them later in my childhood you can bet I was the only twelve year-old in the room whose ears pricked up at the mention of Palladio or Silurian.

This is an element so fleeting in nature that we got to 2015 before someone managed to create one atom of it.

Not taking the opportunity to make people engage with such breakthroughs is a mistake.  I submit that the naming of it is more about making science familiar and interesting than a strict league table of hero worship, and the opportunity presented by this specific confluence of name, meaning and nature is too good to pass up.

Looking online, Uber pocket 15 to 25 per cent of the ride cost, so let's say 80%, or £12.36, goes to the driver.  Less the mileage, that's £5.61 for a 20 minute drive.

Just things, anything.  Volunteer for a charity if you don't have money, pay to do a night class or join a club if you do.  Dance class, flower arranging, improvised comedy, rowing.  Anything that gets you out of the house and among new people.

You're more likely to meet interesting people when you're doing interesting things.

An interview with some of those guys is a total crapshoot, once you pass initial screening, and the best way to come out is simply to be memorable.  A guy admitted to me once he hired a dude for his tie - he had so many roughly equal applicants that the only one he remembered was the one with the wacky tie knot.

Really?  Leased cars are brand new, and if you're smart they are serviced and guaranteed for no extra cost.

All of that costs time and effort as well as money which, if you're unlucky, can quickly add up to be in the same ballpark as a lease anyway.

Yeah, it's *possible* a brand new car will break down and it's *possible* you'll get lucky on a second hand car with one lady owner.  But saying it's ""just as likely"" that a freshly PDI'd model will break down, as that a £1500 shitheap from somebody's front driveway will, is a bit of a stretch.

"Trek are good. I used to work for a Halfords type shop and I can tell you, OP, that the cheapest model from a reputable manufacturer will wipe the floor with the fanciest model by a crap one.

I had a string of seemingly quite decent samples from our supplier, retail price between £90 and £150, and they usually lasted abut a year and a half before rust caught up with them, or various screw threads started to come loose. Then I quit, manned up and got a Trek Soho for about £400 and it did five years, outdoors 24/7 with no cover and all I ever replaced were the brake pads. I rode that thing every day, fell off it, dropped it, the works. The only reason I stopped was it got stolen. Currently on year three with a Pinnacle in the same price range and it's also awesome.

"I have to say,  I've heard some specious bullshit about motoring from Americans in my time but this is actually dangerous. The hand brake is designed to be applied when the car is stopped, to keep it stopped. Nothing more. As regards failure, modern cars have dual circuits hooked up to diagonal pairs of wheels so if one fails you still have at least some braking at the front. If there was any question of the so-called e-brake ever being used to stop the car it would be hooked up to the front wheels.

In the extremely unlikely event of total hydraulic brake failure, engine braking is a hugely superior strategy. Not only are many cars front wheel drive but, in those that aren't, you won't lock up the rear as the hand brake would do.

**If your brakes fail, hit low gear. This will slow the car enormously without robbing you of control.**

Edit: to be fair, both previous replies are probably be saying it's designed *in such a way that it would* work without the hydraulics, rather than deliberately *to* work in such a situation.  However, I'd still argue that if you pull on it and it works as designed, you're going to have a very bad day.

For example Eton, one of the more famous and expensive private schools, actually started out as a free college funded by land given by the King.  It only started charging when wealthy people noticed how good an education could be had there and wanted their sons to go too.  The name ""public school"" stuck for such establishments and when the Victorians introduced universal free education it was taken, so we call government schools ""State"" schools.

First is a too-fast shutter speed; they're much more natural feeling if you have a longer shutter time which blurs the motion in keeping with the slow frame rate.

Second mistake is there's nothing going on and no change from the start to the end.

""Jumble"" is a little harsh for a display that's literally divided up with perpendicular solid lines.  It used to have a symbol-only mode which appears to have been retired for some reason.  Perhaps because it didn't show enough information - sometimes you need the distance and the road name to be sure of what it's asking you to do.

"To get VAT back you will have to be VAT registered, and that means every time you charge any money for anything you will have to charge 20% on top, and pay it back to the Government.  So although you might get £200 back on a £1200 desk, you will also only get to keep £100 out of every £120 you charge out.  Think about it this way: you only get a 'rebate' if you buy in more than you sell, which isn't a sound business plan.

The only situation in which this might be advantageous to you is if you do a lot of corporate work where your clients are, in turn, claiming back the VAT you charge and hence don't care if you charge it or not.  You will *have* to register to collect VAT if your turnover goes over about £70k in a financial year.  People do all kinds of sneaky things to avoid this, like hiding cash transactions, or spinning off parts of the company into separate entities, but this is naturally illegal and the VAT inspectors are notoriously the most uncompromising of all Government enforcement agencies so you would do well not to piss them off.

You might be conflating VAT with income tax, which you will certainly save on equipment you buy since they will be classified as business expenses.  Bear in mind you'll still have to pay for them in full, it's just that you'll pay less income tax at the end of the year.  You don't need to be a company or VAT registered to claim business expenses.

Becoming a limited company might be a smart move in terms of liability however.  The ""Limited"" part means that if somebody is electrocuted, or if your work is shitty and somebody sues you, then only the company is liable.  If you're just a sole trader and somebody sues you, you could lose personal assets like your house.  Looking to the future, it's also a lot easier to sell a limited company than a sole-trader operation, since everything will be in the company's name and you just hand over control.",,2,t3_4qlji2,d4tyu3j,t3_4qlji2,t5_2qgzg

The Apple watch by contrast is just a retardedly flashy version of, as you point out, already much more practical smart watches.

Going forward it will give you ultimate control over how things work and allow you to implement any ideas you have to make your mum's life easier.

It depends on what you want out of the experience. Most web developers now do just customise ready made systems and never write nuts and bolts code. It enables them to get started fast but constrains their ambition only to things that fit the existing framework.

However if you want a career doing interesting stuff rather than cranking out the same bland sites as everyone else then something like this will look great on your CV.

"It's pretty simple, although you should backtrack slightly first.

Instead of using tables, I'd advise you to change the two hour lists to just that - lists.  You could use a UL (unordered list) with each hour as a LI (list item).  Set padding and margins to 0 for both in the CSS and give each LI ""list-style: none;"" to get rid of the bullets and ""float: left;"" and sufficient width/height so they can fit the time text inside - the 100x100 you've gone for so far is fine.  The only missing part is to make #hours and #hours_remote float:left too and give them the property ""overflow:hidden"" so that the floated hour panels don't wrap round onto a new line.  Make sure you give it a decent fixed or ""100%"" width too.

You'll need is to put two days' worth of hours in #hours_remote as I said, for when you cross the midnight line.

Then comes the smart bit.  You stick #hours_remote into a div called, say, #hours_remote_holder, also floated, width'd and overflow:hidden.  Seems superfluous, right?  Well, when you calculate the time offset you just need to figure out the hour difference and then give #hours_remote a *negative* left-margin so that it moves to the left by the required amount, which will be hours*100 (or however many pixels wide each hour is).  Job done.

Obviously you'll need to write it so that you always move forwards in time but I'm sure you can work that out.

Best of luck with it; it's going to be very neat.

"Not quite.  Thing is, a massive increase in business is fine, as long as it's at a profitable price point and it continues afterwards.  Plenty of businesses not only survive a massive rush but change gear and thrive on it.  The problem with Groupon was that it ticked neither of these boxes.  First, the massive rush was at 25% of the normal price (minimum discount 50%, then Groupon take half of what's left) so although you could get economies of scale they would have to be pretty drastic for you not to come out making a loss.  Even that would be surviveable, however, if you converted any of the new customers into long-term profitable prospects.  But the second problem with Groupon is that doesn't happen.  If the first time you come to the spa you're paying £25 for a massage, there is no way in hell you're coming back to get the same thing for £50.

If a big company has excess stock to shift, or needs to get its name out there with some kind of gimmicky one-off, Groupon might possibly work.  But, as their own repeat business was practically nonexistent with business owners realising quickly that it wasn't worth the effort, Groupon marketed themselves ever more aggressively onto tiny, boutique and hand-made style local businesses who just got flattened by the worthless demand.

The worst part is, the one tiny ray of light of getting all that money upfront (i.e. so you can actually buy all this bulk stock you're going to need) didn't exist - the business saw nothing without collecting valid coupon codes and typing them into Groupon's website.  This took a lot of time on top of everything else and also meant that every person who bought a Groupon and didn't cash it in was lining Groupon's pockets without benefitting the poor business owner who'd now maxed out her credit card buying in stock that wasn't getting paid for.

"Ah, you got used to it.  But it was a bit like that episode of Scooby-Doo where they're on a train in a tunnel and they run onto a section of treadmill, the train seemingly still moving at speed while they actually stay still in the tunnel.

The most depressing thing about running that section isn't that though.  At a certain point you give up on the idea that neither the horse nor the castle are ever going to look any nearer or further away, and you stop looking.  Then, all of a sudden, the horse is right in front of you and all you have to do is get up the slight incline to where that photo was taken, and then up the [precipitous hill](http://goo.gl/maps/zABFB) on which the horse stands.

So you gear up, you get pumped, you flick forwards to that MASSIVE PRODIGY TUNE you keep filed under ""adrenaline burn"" in your phone and you POWER DOWN.  Your legs begin to burn but you stretch out, hammering across the road and onto the grass.  The incline ramps up in front of you but your feet are just finding ground sooner to push down as you tear up the hill.  Left, right, left.. your thighs, so powerful a moment before, start to heat up, start to clog with acid.  You try to ignore it, your face contorted and your breath hissing out in strangled gasps.  The incline softens after a hundred yards or so, but it's still hardly flat, so you press on, scraping the very last vestiges of energy from the walls of a calorie store that was empty before you began your crazed assault.

And then, finally, gloriously, you reach the first of the scattered stones at the foot of the horse.  And there's a family there having a picnic as you bend over, snot and sweat streaming from your wretched face as your wracked lungs struggle for sweet, sweet air and, through all the pain, you realise: you've done it!  You made it up to the...

..and at that point a gang of super fit 17 year-olds from the rowing club catch up, nimbly skip over the stones to slap a hand on the horse's pedestal and then, nonchalantly and barely breaking stride, turn 180 degrees and head back to town.  They aren't even out of breath.  And you feel about 150 years old as you debate calling a cab for the return trip.",t1_cd0rrsv,2,t1_cd0qka6,cd0rrsv,t3_1p9s7h,t5_2qh0u

"&gt; provided there is traffic on the left lane that I am passing

This is the key.  Of course all three lanes are there to be used.  However, if there's room for somebody to undertake you and pull back out without crowding your safe stopping distance, you should not have been in the middle or outside lane.

&gt; The only catch here is that every motorist has to know what each lane is for and where they should be in the scheme of things.

This is bullshit, sadly.  Making up ""what each lane is for"" is just justifying what's convenient for your lazy driving style.  If the lane you're in is holding you up, move right.  If the lane to your left is clear, move left.  It's that simple, and it's in the highway code I quoted above.

Changing lanes, however frequently, isn't dangerous.  If it is, you're doing it wrong.  If anything, constantly watching to see if there's room to pull in - and doing so - keeps your mind on the job.  Banging on the cruise control and zoning out in the middle lane when there's a clear half mile of empty space on the inside lane is much more conducive to being surprised by something unusual.

I think our Venn circles mostly overlap on this.  It's just that you see lane-hogging as a harmless extension of normal behaviour whereas I see it as irritating and dangerous lawbreaking.

Gearboxes which howl, or where the synchromesh can be ‘beaten’ by a quick gear change, may continue to perform for a long time in this state. A worn gearbox usually needs a complete rebuild to eliminate noise because the various gears, if re-aligned on new bearings, will continue to howl when different wearing surfaces are presented to each other.

"*Sigh*

Brown's is remarkable only in the sense that it neither looks, not smells, very inviting at all from the outside., but once you're inside it it's often an eye opening and pleasurable experience for all concerned. Don't be waylaid by the chippie next door. Brown's is often somewhere you go almost by accident, while aiming for a fish supper, but it's definitely worth an excursion on its own.

Just be aware, if fish *is* on the menu, you weren't the first to partake that evening. Doesn't bother some, but can be a deal breaker for me.

Edit: Just realised you're OP and probably not going to realise this .. wasn't serious.  Brown's is actually a very pleasant bar/restaurant by the river in Windsor and a particularly lovely spot for lunch if you can get a seat on the upper balcony.  I would also recommend the Coach and Horses pub (just near the statue of Queen Victoria out the front of the castle) as it's just about the most stereotypically traditional English pub in the world.

"I think the point is that people who tailgate rarely do it because they've forgotten not to tailgate.  They're not skillful drivers, they're already pissed off, they're being aggressive and the only way to get rid of them is either (a) to speed off faster than they can - and I do mean ""can"" since they will often continue to tailgate you up through 100 just to show off how much you were in their way - or (b) to let them by.  Flashing brake lights, slowing down, waving, giving the finger etc tends simply to enrage them more and cause further risktaking behaviour like undertaking (although if they have room to do this, you're in the wrong) and so on.

Having said all that, I do remember being closely followed by a woman while I was on a driving lesson.  Being inexperienced I felt the pressure to keep my speed up and entered a roundabout faster than I should have.  Leaning over to change down into 3rd I missed and went into 1st.  When I let the clutch up the car almost stopped, and of course with no brake lights.  I was as you can imagine quite flustered by this but managed to limp through the roundabout and out the other side and when I finally remembered to look in the mirror again she was about 100 yards behind me and staying there.  So I guess that technique works.

In other news, I also did the IAM course.. in South Africa.  That shit was so nutty it's not recognised in Europe.  It had mandatory paranoia like counting your wheel nuts before setting off, and always having the doors locked.

"When I was 23 I became unemployed and moved back in with my folks to look for a job. It sucked balls to have moved away and failed and I was desperate to do anything that got me back on an independent path. By happy accident (nobody else applied) I got offered a job running a retail website for a decent size retail chain here in the UK (200 shops).  The problem? My PHP was basic,  my CSS was not much beyond the :hover attribute and I knew no MySQL. I repeat: I did not know what a select statement was. And yet here I was taking sole technical responsibility for the website of a multi-million pound a year company. Out of my depth? Fuck,  I had to go to store manager meetings with 200 guys who'd fought their way to manager status at the sharp end of retail, despite my having never picked up a price gun in my life. I shook with fear at the idea one of them would ask what my background was.

I could have been honest and owned up to my shortcomings. But at the time I was adamant that I would do anything not to go back to my parents' spare room and I simply threw myself into learning as fast as I could so that I could overtake the minimum knowledge level required to do my job before I got fired.

I was in that job three years and when I quit they begged me to stay. I built the rest of my career (I'm 36 now) on the skills I learned in a mad panic over the first six weeks in that job.

"It's not all bad; you just have to take a bit of a punt if you want to make the best of the situation.  I recommend [spareroom.co.uk](http://spareroom.co.uk) as a good way to hook up with potential flatmates.  They have great social events where people wander about with area and budget written on badges.  You save a lot of time which would've been wasted doing viewings for people who were an instant 'no' when you opened the door.

HOWEVER as you're probably realising there is a huge skew towards people looking for a room as opposed to people with a room to rent, so if you can possibly put yourself in the latter camp you're going to be well ahead of the game.  I have done this twice before, taking on a whole property I couldn't afford on my own and then going to the socials to have my pick of the tenants looking.  Having lived with some right mentals I judge the few hundred quid spent on the empty room for a couple of weeks to be well worth it.  It's never taken longer than a fortnight to find someone pleasant in London; there are simply that many people looking.

Just make 100% sure you have a bulletproof plan for getting their name on the lease without further expense.  Some agents will charge you through the nose for any change so if you can find somewhere where you're dealing directly with the landlord so much the better.  (i.e. look for the flat on Spareroom or gumtree rather than foxton's)  One time I said my mate had pulled out, after paying the deposit, (but I totally had a replacement lined up who just happened to be indisposed for a week or so...) and gambled (successfully) on their laziness carrying me over until I found a replacement.

It's not for everyone, and I'm sure plenty of people will reply to me saying this is a risky approach, which it is, but if you cover your bases it will be easier on your nerves in the long run than moving in with some random weirdo just because you can't find a place - and that *will* eventually happen if you don't take the lead on your situation.",t1_cqsl8ex,7,t3_349odh,cqsl8ex,t3_349odh,t5_2qkog

You could photograph people and say, well, if there's more than a certain amount of clear room behind you on the inside lane then you're done but what if the reason you're in the middle lane is just that you've overtaken a middle-lane-hog and you're still en route to the inside lane?

"&gt; you should match the speed of the traffic in the lane you're in

Well yes obviously huge trucks which take upwards of a minute to pass each other are incredibly annoying (especially when they end up giving up and pulling back in, always a classic) but I'm talking about an increased level of frustration that is palpable when you drive under the limit.  In fact, I've heard from IAM instructors that driving more than 3mph under the limit is dangerous because it encourages people to take a risk and overtake.  Apparently if you're at the limit they are more likely to think, well, the risk of death *and* points isn't enough to bother.

The point, to me, is just that raising the speed limit increases the expected speed, the normal speed.  Whatever the safety stats say, there isn't a car made which doesn't tail off in efficiency over about 60mph.  Much as I love speed, I also love breathing and not being insanely poor.

As an aside, regarding ""I overtake on public roads at 85mph because it's safer"" - do you really think for one second that a cop who clicks you doing *25mph over the limit on the wrong side of the road* is going to care about your opinion on road safety?

"London isn't really for relaxing unless you're used to a fairly hectic city.  My advice is to start there while you're full of energy, prioritise a few things you want to see over 3-4 days, then head into the countryside to relax.  Do yourselves a favour and rent a car again if you can afford it.

&gt; We are relaxed, low-key people that like to take in the history and see the sights.

For history:

* Stonehenge is a bit disappointing now that it's fenced off and isn't our only ancient monument.  We have all sorts of ancient sites all over the place.  Pick an area and do some Googling to find stuff like chalk figures and old Roman forts.
* If you're into that sort of thing, the [National Trust](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/) is a network of country estates which are almost all worth a visit, especially if you are American and haven't really spent time in historical buildings.  It can be expensive so if you get excited about this, look into getting annual membership as it gives you free entry may add up to being cheaper than visiting 5 or more separately.

For countryside:

* The Cotswolds are beautiful and easily reached from London in about 2 hours.  Pockets of insane expense are merely the result of city types buying second homes.  Remember locals live there too and there are plenty of cheap pub meals to be had.
* The Lake District is further north but literally hiking nirvana.  It's protected by some of the strictest planning authorities in the country so there is little to no eyesore construction and just mile after mile of drystone walls, cottages and rolling hills.  Investigate cottages to rent online but you may already be a bit late.

PM me if you are struggling with accommodation in either of these places.  You seem to be hitting the second half of the schools' Summer term (June 11 to July 23) pretty much exactly so you shouldn't find that 
things are insanely busy.

Towns to aim for:

* Windsor is a great first stop outside London.  Thousand year-old castle (do the tour) plus a huge park which can suck up a whole day of exploring.
* Oxford is easier to reach than Cambridge but the latter is arguably prettier, as it's more spread out and has more green space.  See both and report back!
* Bath is stunning; if you read any Jane Austen you need to go there.  Added bonus is it's next to Bristol which is a youthful and fun town to stay in.

"44% Match
60% Friend
31% Enemy

We dated for a year or so a few years back.  Looking in my messages folder it was her that 'winked' at me; I doubt I would have made the first move with stats like that.  However, looking through our common questions now, a lot of the incompatibility comes from either contrariness (I'm quite flippant with some answers) or the fact that culturally and linguistically she's not an English native.  For example, she answered ""yes"" to the one about creationism in schools, saying it is essential to understand religion because it informs so much of history - missing the point that this question is actually about whether you're a nutjob who trusts the Bible over scientific research.  So we're probably more compatible than 44% would suggest.

Right from the off she was very offhand and dismissive of the idea we would have any relationship, which suited me as I'd just come out of a long term deal which hadn't ended well.  This was good man-psychology though because it made me work for her attention and I ignored it when little flags popped up that she might not be quite right for me.  The differences between us were stimulating rather than an obstacle and the fact that we evidently found each other attractive physically didn't hurt either.

She was mental in an intoxicating, exciting way that was very hard to leave.  I'm talking about leaping off me mid-coitus and locking herself in her bathroom bawling about how incompatible we were and how I should ""just leave"" (at 4am and miles from my home) for ten minutes before busting back out and pinning me to the bed with the most aggressive, intense sex I think I've experienced.

Even after we broke up she would call occasionally out of the blue saying things like, ""my breasts look amazing in the sunlight this morning, come over and photograph them"" (which remains my favourite phone call, ever).  Eventually, after a year of her ringing me for booty calls every few months, she wigged out and accused me of ""only ever calling her for sex"".  We haven't spoken since.

I suppose it's a classic ""dick in crazy"" story except I seem to have escaped having my CDs hammered or half my wages siphoned into an alimony black hole.  So yay me I guess.

TLDR: great sex, probably not compatible.  And no I don't have the photos; we used her camera.",t1_c8clx2f,22,t3_188p5v,c8clx2f,t3_188p5v,t5_2rct2

On the table is every piece of fancy cutlery and decoration you can find, around two Pot Noodles, or paper wraps of chips, or something else you happen to have had the first morning you ever woke up together, along with a rose made out of all the train tickets you bought visiting her that time when she had a job placement in the country.

"I have a 4k plus a rotatable 1080p, usually in portrait, off to the side.

When developing I find that the bigger screen is not that much more useful.  Although in theory I can have four big windows open in the same space, it's actually quite fiddly positioning them so that they have enough elbow room inside but don't interfere or overlap in annoying ways.  Creative Suite in particular has floating palettes which get all over the place and, if you have multiple apps open, can get confused.  In a way, four 1080p screens would be better as I could maximise each application to its own working space.

But on its own the 4k is [feckin' fantastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjJdnFD2VpY).",,2,t3_5vr2ko,de47iex,t3_5vr2ko,t5_2qs0q
"Profitablity needs at least one of:

* large market
* low manufacturing cost

Pebble had

* a small enthusiastic market
* who demanded great specs

Additionally

* Nerds like things the mainstream don't
* adapting to mainstream tastes alienates launch audience

He thinks Oppo made this leap by luring the early adopters with great specs and open architecture and then dropping them and aggressively pandering to the mass market with locked OS and emphasis on selfies.

"I was once leaving a real ale beer festival after a long afternoon drinking things with names like ""Dr Gutrot's Stygian Stench Stout"".  Happily refreshed, my forward planning was not at its peak as I crowded into an underground train along with the thronging masses of tipsy brew enthusiasts, and it did not occur to me to effect a tactical evacuation of the nascent gas bubble forming in my nether regions before embarking.

Three stops in and the enormity of my mistake became apparent. The growling in my pipework was getting harder to ignore and the pressure at the gates was mounting with every jolt.  I faced a vexing dilemma: I wanted desperately to hold on until my destination but with four stops to go and an appreciable increase in stress with every passing moment I knew this was not without risk.  I toyed with the idea of a one-cheek puff which might relieve enough pressure to enable me to survive the journey but that would require the kind of sphincter control normally associated with a flautist's lips and not the ravaged, spent bunghole that thirty years of curry and Guinness had won me.

Reader, I gambled.  I knew I could do it.  I'm not a child; I know all the tricks.  I clenched and I moved about.  I leaned against the wall.  I sat awkwardly on that little bench thing by the door, one cheek squeezed up against the other, so my entire upper body weight was employed in a pressure retention operation that would have impressed the guys that put up the Hoover Dam.  Two stops went by.  Three.  Then a jolt pulling out of the fourth nearly dislodged me from my seat.  I managed to hold on but definitely felt the tiniest mosquito's cough sneak out between my terrified cheeks.

I tried to quell the panic and gripped the bars, bracing to see if it stank enough for the thronged crowds to notice.  There was nothing.  Briefly.  Then Mr Hankey's gay flatmate burst in, viciously stuck his erect shit-cock up my nose and flooded my sinuses with bum gas.  Dear God.  For so much of my life I'd been under the blissful impression that one's own effluent was less offensive than others' and yet this, this tiny forward scout of the massed army assembling in what felt like the entire length of my poor gut, was so pungent, so powerful, so downright radioactive that every hair in my nostrils stood on end, saluted and died instantly.  I choked back vomit as my eyes flooded with tears and, before I could take control of my muscles, reflexively opened my mouth.  This was the tipping point.

Smelling a fart is one thing.  To taste it, dear reader, is to see God in all His wrath.  Millennia of evolution had tried its hardest to punish my ancestors into avoiding getting even one molecule of excrement into the front end of my digestive system and now my brain was flooded with signals that I had just bitten into a double-strength Mississippi shit cake.  It was too much, and in all the excitement my ringpiece gave up the ghost.

Have you ever been to the zoo?  Have you heard the angry, glottal roar of an injured lion, echoing into a concrete pen?  Imagine such a sound but played in reverse.  There was no initial explosion, but rather a soft growl that grew in waves as a feedback system meant the increasing foulness of the stench flowing to my face brought me closer to a catastrophic failure of arse-seal.  For five long seconds the trumpeting of an approaching horde of randy elephants built and echoed through the carriage, causing those nearest me to turn in amusement.

""Sew a button on that,"" cried one wag.

Another: ""Speak up, Brown; you're through!""

""One more turn and she would've started!""

""A confident appeal by the Austral..."" the fourth was cut short.

It is an oft-quoted ""fact"" that placing a frog in cold water and slowly bringing it to the boil can cause the hapless amphibian not to notice it is being cooked alive.  No such luck for those on the 23:24 from Earls Court that fateful Summer evening.  The white heat of the offensive hit them suddenly and irreversibly, fogging up glasses and bleaching delicate fabrics as it flooded through the enclosed space like a fire through a 1970s variety club dressing room.  Witticisms were replaced by gutteral exclamations. ""Gas, boys; Gas!"" cried one as he floundered for the other end of the carriage, clawing at the other passengers in a vain attempt to escape Turd Zero.  But even those who did break from the door-bound throng suffered a cruel irony - their very movement agitated the smell and brought it with them, poisoning the very fresh air they sought to reach.

As the panic reached its peak, the train slowed and, through the tears in my stinging eyes, I perceived the doors spring open.  I launched myself out of the train, certain that the grasping hands were my fellow travellers effecting an attempted arrest as a precursor to exacting a terrible revenge on the poisoner of their journey.

But as I staggered out into the fresh night air, no such retribution came.  I turned and looked at the carnage inside, the torn newspapers and trodden-on hats, the glasses all askew and the woman dry retching into her handbag.  And it hit me - *they were so preoccupied with survival they didn't know who the culprit was*.

I paused, blood rushing back to my face, and smoothed down the front of my shirt.  The doors were beeping shrilly, faint wafts of my epic trouser disaster puffing clouds against the clear night sky.

""TWAS I, YOU FOOLS,"" I cried as the doors slid shut on their mobile prison.  ""AND I'D DO IT AGAIN IN A FARTBEAT.""

And for one brief moment, as thirty furious tube passengers willed the very vengeance of Satan upon me with their impotent little eyes, I knew what it was like to be hated like that other stinky shitlord Piers Morgan.",,3,t1_dfwr9so,dfxknzx,t3_63qgxx,t5_2qh33

"As /u/markvauxhall pointed out, private cars are actually a model for how these things should work.  We all agree cars should be parked b the side of the road, and those that are illegally parked get ticketed and/or moved.  Privately owned rental cars that live on the street, like Zipcar, Bluecity etc all have designated bays.  Avis park their unused cars off street because it would be antisocial and rude if they took up all the spaces up and down the road outside their offices with empty vehicles.  Technically it wouldn't be illegal, since cars are allowed to be parked by the side of the road, but it would be inconsiderate and wasteful of the space, and the council would probably get involved to stop them.

So where's the line between that, and what happened here?  The answer to me is that in this situation the cyclist had no good reason to believe the driver could see him.  He's in the wrong, but I can empathise a little with the mistake he made.  In his head, once he was ahead, he had no need to worry about people coming from behind.

The difference here is that Uber are the ones issuing the invoice.  If they are reselling the drivers' services, they owe VAT.  If they are collecting money on behalf of the drivers, they should be listing the VAT amount and the driver's VAT number and, which is my point, charging the drivers a percentage of the ex-VAT amount, not the gross amount.

I'm sure very few Uber drivers are turning over £83,000 (the maximum you can take in a year without collecting VAT) but if there is even one, and Uber's system doesn't issue the correct paperwork, Uber will have quite a time of it defending themselves.

We all undertake stationary traffic all day long and, while some may briefly overtake again when the light goes green, there's no question of hanging back behind every vehicle, particuarly when stopped.

I can totally empathise.

So if you charge your customers £85,000 in a year you are obliged to collect an extra £17,000 VAT even if your profit is only 50p.  In fact you can make a massive loss and you still have to pass that VAT on.

"Argentina and the UK had actually (at the behest of the UN) been discussing at very least co-governance, if not transfer to Argentina entirely, since the sixties.  The islanders, however, weren't keen and the UK government was loathe to treat its own citizens, however barren and far away their home, so poorly as to give away their land from under them.

Argentina, pissed off at the lack of progress, fancied the islands back.  They knew the islands didn't have much going on by way of defences and, while you're right and they knew the UK wouldn't be a pushover in person, they also knew that actually showing up to the party was going to be a massive ballache for the Brits and gambled that they wouldn't bother.

Of course, Thatcher grasped the opportunity to be a war Prime Minister with both hands.  The Argentine army had the opportunity at that point to withdraw but I am guessing they figured they had the advantage of being there first, a good stock of fast attack jets all ready to go, and of course the lethal, ship-sinking Exocet missiles from France.

However, even these advantages were eroded by (a) the longest bombing run in history at that point, involving planes to refuel planes to refuel the bombers (seriously, look it up - it was insane) which damaged the runway too much for the jets to take off and (b) one of the sneakiest bits of espionage outside of a James Bond film, where Mi5 tied up all the Exocets they could find in bogus deals which never went through, but kept the missiles from being sold to Argentina.

Once the actual soldiers showed up the conscript Argentine soldiers had already had enough.  History, being written by the winners, does not give a clear picture of whether the Belgrano was actually retreating, and it's entirely possible that the British forces had travelled too far, and staged too impressive a Vulcan attack, simply to shake hands and go home again.  And it's not as if the British walked it; HMS Sheffield was sunk and they lost almost half as many men as the invaders.

"Ah, Mercator strikes again.

If you draw a straight line through Norway and double it in the same direction you get to northern Morocco, that is true.  But only on a Mercator map, which exaggerates distances closer to the poles.  Using the tool I linked above, you'll find that the true distance, in miles across the globe's surface, doesn't get that far south.

I mean, don't get me wrong, it's still pretty damn surprising.  If you mirror image Norway about Mandal, the southernmost town, you get roughly halfway down Italy.  Skarsvåg, Norway and Porto San Giorgio, Italy are both around 1055 miles from Mandal.  That's a straight north/south reflection as per the 'stand it up on the southern point and let it drop' wording suggests.  Continuing west as far as Norway stretches east as suggested by the Morocco answer gives you a place called Castex near Toulouse in France.

1050 miles due south of Mandal is in the med, which is probably the part my half-scrambled brain remembered.

To illustrated, [all three distances in this image are 1050-1055 miles](https://i.imgur.com/KMd7JXU.png) as the crow flies.  As you can see, Africa is still some way off.

"When I was in high school and poor, my mates and I got into charity shops in a big way.  It was mostly a cost saving exercise but every now and again you'd strike gold.  One time my mate actually found the first ever ""Now that's what I call music"" - it didn't even have a number and was a steal at only 50p.

Anyway, one day I came across a velvet suit.  Not just a jacket (I had already scored one of those) but trousers too - *flared* trousers no less.  I immediately ran into the changing rooms and tried it on.  It was a perfect fit, amazingly for my wiry teenage frame.  I had to admit it was a little stingy in space around the crotch and the jacket was cut quite high but naturally these were small concessions for the STYLE DYNAMITE that I had become in my velvet suit.

I reappeared in front of my friends who, instead of gasping in awe, began laughing like the jackals in ""The Lion King"".  In between gasps of mirth, one of them croaked out, ""It's.. it's a woman's suit dude.""

It was an all-boys' school.  I was ""the tranny"" for the rest of that year.

"It wasn't a criticism.  There's just something very German about using basic words with no nuance to discuss high-minded, educated matters.  The British style is more prosaic, meaning we like to sound credible and educated by referencing well-known literary phrases or using slightly unusual words that carry the precise connotations we wish to convey.  The idea is to communicate subtly that we've thought about the matter deeply and chosen a precise word.

The German attitude is to take the first word that means what you want to say, and use it.  The enthusiasm for portmanteau bolted-together nouns comes from a similar place; why invent a new word for ""seal"" when *seehund* (literally ""sea-dog"") says what you need?

""The British government seems to enjoy empty discussion as much as it lacks strategic focus"" would have been something I'd expect to read in *The Economist* but ""lacks a clear concept despite talking a lot"" sounds more like an ADHD child's school report.  It's not *wrong* in any way, it's just.. straightforward and jarring to this British ear.

Talk about the potential for things to work better, and be more profitable, if store managers could be less stressed with higher level operations, and weren't duplicating work or sourcing or whatever it is that you think a manager would improve. Estimate some cash figures for how much is being wasted. Do not be afraid of coming off stupid for not seeing that a manager is the solution. Your pro active attitude and insight will be noticed and they'll get a kick out of coming up with the solution. It's all good.

"Retail is funny.  On the one hand, 5% sounds like very little to the untrained ear. On the other hand, 5% of a £240,000 house sale is good money even if you make nothing for weeks beforehand.  Likewise, £4 doesn't sound like a lot, and 5% of £4 is only 20p, but on the other if you literally have a queue all day and are taking £4 every thirty seconds that's nearly twenty five quid an hour.

Until you get there you just don't know how much business you're going to do, and hence how well you will be paid.  The percentage, and the individual item value, aren't enough information to ascertain this.  So yeah, in a small way you're justified in your paranoia that people might twig that you're not the most experienced sales agent in London.  That said, a ""queue all day"" is extremely unlikely, and for every hour that's busy, you're sandbagging against the quiet hours, 11am on a Tuesday for example, when nobody's doing anything, and those times will drain your average earnings relentlessly.

One thing of which you can be certain is that the kind of people who make money employing people to sell dirt-cheap fried snacks to tourists for £4 a pop aren't doing so because they are enlightened employers.  They do know how busy it will be, and they are offering the absolute bare minimum required to make sure their stall is staffed.  Whatever the numbers, you almost certainly will not get rich selling churros at Winter Wonderland, pretty much by definition.  In a way I'd be *more* suspicious if they were offering 20%.

Minimum wage, however, is just that: a minimum.  If they offer you minimum wage OTE, that's not legal.  I do a few retail events where we pay minimum plus 10% commission, usually around a hundred a day extra, but that minimum is absolutely above minimum wage.  The whole point of being a business owner is that you take the risk, not your staff.

Keep your eyes open, good opportunities do exist.  But you're right to think they don't generally involve doing something that lots of other people are doing, for illegally low basic.",,1,t1_dr2z8nr,dr30chf,t3_7iluvk,t5_2qkog

"A distant relative of mine was a Holocaust escapee who settled in Johannesburg. He ran a successful manufacturing business until he retired in the 1980s.  Within a year or two he got bored, so he set up a new business in Soweto - the largely very deprived township outside the white city limits - which exclusively employed learning-impaired locals to make simple toys and gadgets, and ran as a nonprofit.

Anyway, one night this old guy and his wife got carjacked outside a restaurant.  The one crime the cops did have time for over there was murder so the jackers tended to leave you alone if you just handed over the keys, and the elderly couple made it home safely.  In the morning, he took a cab to the factory.

One of the local guys, a shady gangster-looking chap in ripped jeans and jewellery, was dropping off his brother.  He noticed the cab and asked what happened.  ""Remind me,"" he said.  ""What's your number plate again?""

*That evening* there was a knock on the door and the same guy is there.

""We found your car,"" he says, jabbing his thumb over his shoulder at their Toyota parked neatly outside the gate.  ""What do you want us to do with the guys that took it?""

"Let's say I start a shitposting service.  I need £30 to get the business off the ground.

I borrow £10 from you.

I borrow £10 from Steve.

I borrow £10 from Shirley.

I'm repaying you all back at a rate of £1 a week, so as long as I have £3 a week to spend on repaying you all, everything is fine.

Now imagine that for some reason you want me to repay you early, after only three weeks.  I still owe each of you £7 but I don't have an income stream, and I spent £9 on a ""Shitposter General"" branded hat so let's say I only have £12 to my name.

If you get nervous that I'm never going to make any money and decide you just want what you can get, you can sue for me to go bankrupt and have my assets divided among everyone to whom I owe money.  So you, Steve and Shirley would get £4 each.  But maybe Steve and Shirley don't want the money right now.  They believe that if they wait long enough they'll get their full £10 back.  So nobody makes me bankrupt because even though it might suit them, it would screw over everyone else.

Now what happens if the reason you want early repayment is because you're struggling to make payments on your own loan from Janet?  If Janet makes *you* bankrupt, your loan to me is an asset which now needs to be liquidated to make payment to Janet.  But Janet, now, would be screwing over Steve and Shirley even though they have nothing to do with her.

The situation is now that nobody in the chain can go bust without massive wider consequences.  I don't really have to make payments on my loans because I can just whine to my creditors that they'll damage society at large if they wind me up, and I will *totally* pay them eventually, just not right now. 

This is exactly how Trump does business.  Everyone is so exposed that nobody wants to wind up his bullshit, loss-making endeavours for fear that other perfectly legitimate businesses will go down with him.",,4,t1_dsd8jow,dsdbjpn,t3_7ovzwr,t5_2qh33

"Eh, I disagree.  It's useful information for people to realise that IMEI blocks, 'find my phone' and so on aren't going to protect them, and conversely that bike chains, covers, alarms and airlock doors really do reduce your chances of getting hit.  We place a lot of store in assuming that it just won't happen when we could, with minimal effort, make ourselves less vulnerable by thinking about it from the criminal's perspective.

There's an odd moment of almost paternal concern when the guy says, ""people are crossing the road staring at their phone - that's not normal"".  He's a cunt but he's got a point - why are we not sufficiently motivated by the threat of being crushed by a car to pay attention while wandering around in front of them?  Frankly, if the threat of losing your phone motivates you more than the idea of being run over you have your priorities just as scrambled as someone who steals for a living.

Most of these guys are targeting low-hanging fruit, not mindlessly spreading violence and destruction and profiting on the side.  There was good defensive info in here for those willing to see past just feeling indignant about the criminality.

Taking steps to defend yourself isn't victim-blaming either.  Of course these guys *shouldn't* do what they do.  But we're definitely straying, as a society, over a line which makes it insufficiently hard for them to make a living as criminals and anything you can do to reduce your likelihood of being a victim is helpful.

I mean, fuck; another crime wave sweeping this town is law-abiding, sensible people who type on their phone while driving, risking death and disfigurement to others, just so they can *reply to a text*.  I don't see that as any more justifiable than stealing a bike to make money.  A video from a moped driver sharing tips for other bikers like, ""look for drivers glancing down"" or ""notice when people drift out of their lane slightly"" would be lauded for saving lives, no?  Or would it be ""glamorising scum"" if it was a text-and-driver making the same points?",,8,t1_duloloq,dumnu8q,t3_7z5g92,t5_2qkog
"See, I don't disagree with any of your general points, obviously, but I just didn't find this piece 'glamorous' at all.  The presenter explicitly calls them ""scummy"" to their faces, asks them how they feel about their victims and says she feels ""disgusted"" by their attitude.

&gt;  Let’s not forget some of these fuckers have chucked acid at people to nick their bikes.

I may have a short attention span but I'm pretty sure exactly this was in the film. The presenter explicitly asks a thief how he feels about hurting people on minimum wage to make a dishonest buck.  I'm not sure that glamorises anything.

It's ironic that someone on this thread is accusing this film of pandering to ""pearl clutching"" drama queens, when basically every post ITT is doing exactly that without having actually watched the thing.  This is a good, brave and level headed film about appalling crime, and if it gives some people insight to making themselves less vulnerable I welcome it.",,3,t1_dun0ec0,dun832o,t3_7z5g92,t5_2qkog

When she asks for tips for people to make themselves less of a target, the thief actually obliges.  If you can step back from being appalled, there was good info in there.

"I was 24 and on the bones of my arse when a mate invited me to go to the Ascot races with him.  I literally couldn't split the cab fare to get there, that's how skint I was, but it was a work jolly to impress some young execs (he actually ended up dating one of them for a while) and he was happy to comp me a few drinks in exchange for some banter.

What surprised me was the way the employees from the other company were betting.  They were not big earning guys and they were slapping £20, £50 bets down like it was nothing.  One of them was a couple of hundred down within an hour or two.  Forced by penury not to partake, I just spent time chatting to some of the girls and, perhaps because I didn't have my nose in the odds book, one of them and I hit it off.

She wanted to put a bet on and, as flirtatious women do, she wanted me to hold her hand while she did it.  Once we were at the window, of course, it felt gauche not to do the same so I picked a horse in a rush just for its name - ""Mr Aviator"" to match my sunglasses - and put on £5 ""each way"", because that left me another £5 to get home and there's less chance of losing because you get reduced odds for a 2nd or 3rd place finish.  Unfortunately, I didn't know that ""£5 each way"" means £5 to win and £5 for the other two places.  Even through the booze I was gripped with horror as I realised that would completely clean me out for the day.  Still, I wanted to get laid so I coughed up my train fare and we rejoined the group.

Now it must be said that the guys who'd been betting all afternoon had been taking plenty of opportunity to crow about how much they knew about betting, and 'the form', and the state of the ground, etc, and if I've ever been mansplained to it was by these twats, who were taking every opportunity to tell me what slips, and odds, and ""expected gain"" meant.  I think the bravado had taken on a life of its own and they'd all over-spent on the afternoon trying to impress each other, and me, and while I have to admit I was surprised by the lack of success I certainly felt they deserved it for being dicks.  However, as they'd started to run out of money their attention was wandering from the racetrack and as I returned with the young lady I found one of them very brashly elbowing his way into the conversation.  My first instinct was to try and repel him but, I won't lie, I was kind of hoping I could nudge him into offering her a drink, which would buy me another half an hour or so before I had to come up with a sudden excuse to leave because I literally couldn't afford a glass of cheap Chardonnay at that point.

I stood there and tried to bat him off just enough without bringing things to a head, when in the background I heard it.

""Mr Aviator challenging on the outside...""

I looked down at my ticket.  It said 33-1.  I looked down the raceway and, sure enough, the fucker was right on the inside, poking up next to the race leader with his jockey low down and strangely still.  It was like the pivotal scene in an eighties movie as the gambler smarmed up to the girl in front of me while, over his shoulder, the pack came thundering down towards us.

That glorious equine bastard crossed the line first by barely a head.  I have never heard such a sound as that tannoy - ""and it's Mr Aviator, Mr Aviator followed by-"" by ""who gives a shit"", and ""I am off to the bar"" in third.

""Sorry mate,"" I said to the gambler, literally interrupting him by sticking my bet slip right in his smug face. ""Was this the *winner* in that race?""  I showed it to another guy who had also been a rude cock.  ""Is 33-1 good odds then?  Did I win something?""  Their faces were a torment of envious hatred.  Fuck, it was delicious.

I left, with the girl, and went to pick up the winnings: £230.  On a whim, I went upstairs and bought two bottles of champagne on ice at £60 each.  Screw it, easy come, easy go.  And watching those fucks take my wine and thank me for it was worth twenty times what I paid.

It could have been an absolute classic case of a toxic early win but, somehow, every time I thought of that day I would remember those other guys, with their empty posturing and drained wallets.  I got the girl's number but she cancelled our first date and we never met again.

We all know that this research will be cited by people who haven't read the whole thing, and that it will be reported upon in the press missing details not obvious from a quick scan.  The article linked is unusual in that it picked up on this huge factor, and even then it was only mentioned in passing as an argument that the research was *more* reliable because it had no gender effect.  (I would have said, ""no inter-gender effect"" but what do I know)  I'm just concerned that they didn't see fit to mention the word ""female"" in the summary, and perceive a blasé attitude to potentially significant data which is dully familiar from reading the few hundred papers I came across back in the day.  It wasn't unusual to find overlapping trials from two different papers which gave opposite conclusions, or to see lines like, ""while not significant, this data implies.."" which is the kind of horseshit that makes physicists snort with laughter.

I agree that this research is useful, and of course it contributes to our understanding beyond the specific constraints of the trials reported, but the way it's presented, and the way the linked article reported it, weren't quite as honest as I'd like.",,1,t1_dmoi8hi,dmoqy61,t3_6yeq2s,t5_2qhqb

"I used to do this a couple of times a week and my approach was to sack off the endless red lights through town and head south to the river before cruising along the embankment.  This gives you an almost clear run to Parliament, then another fairly uninterrupted cruise until the road naturally swings North when you get to Chelsea.  Sure there are a couple of roundabouts and lights but most of the traffic is pretty chilled out and with only the bridges approaching from the left it's noticeably less stressful than a normal road.  You run north up Finborough Road, which is a one-way and hence easy to weave your way up fairly safely, until you turn left on Brompton Road, becoming Lillie Road, then the last little bit you can either do along the shared pedestrian/cycle riverbank or up Fulham Palace Road which has a bus lane almost all the way to Hammersmith.

"Sounds like you had a particularly flaccid experience, sorry OP.  I was there in the evening on Friday and it was a lot better than you describe; I sampled a couple of different dishes that the group bought, including Hartnett's BBQ pork and they were pretty good.  It was also busy and had a friendly crowd with decent beer on tap.

That said the food was a bit of a rip, with the headline prices being on the upper end of what I'll pay for street food and hovering around the lower end of what I'd consider an appropriate portion.  Also the queues!  Jesus.  I'm a veteran of outdoor festival dining and even so I was a bit taken aback by multitudes of wealthy adults stood single-file as if they were nostalgic for the school canteen.  It was like a joke piece from SNL about those wacky Brits and their love for lining up.  One place (wood pigeon kebabs, /r/madlads) was rattling through their backlog by issuing tickets so you could come back to get your food when it was ready but what they gained in efficiency they pissed away on poor planning - they had run out of chips and were basically peddling a large mouthful for £6.50 and a fifteen minute wait.

Oh yeah, and A PINT OF ALE WAS SIX FIFTY.

It's an odd combination of expensive and inefficient, something you see at a lot of Kensington / Hurlingham / Richmond type events where the main draw is feeling like you're experiencing the magic of multicultural London without the inconvenience of having to travel more than a mile or, you know, mix with any brown people.  In fact one of the girls I was chatting to opined unironically that the £15 ""keeps the riff raff out"".  It also covers the shortfall from guests with light appetites; the entire evening long I saw her eat one gyoza, probably because the poor mite had something of a sniffly cold coming on and had to pop to the ladies' every ten minutes or so to blow her nose.

It's a fucking food market in Kensington.  I'm not sure why any of the above was a surprise to me.  Probably because I drank four pints on an empty stomach (save for a wood pigeon blini and mouthful of celebrity pig meat).",,65,t3_6gt7ze,diswkvv,t3_6gt7ze,t5_2qkog

* The battery lasts 7 days, which is approximately 10,000 times as long as it takes to read the product details page on a website

* Includes a microphone so you can make notes, search the web through lmgtfy.com or reply to texts by speaking phrases such as ""is there an online review of Pebble 2?""

* The display is very clear and easy to read, just like web pages on sites such as Amazon and reevoo which have customer reviews of lots of products

* The strap is waterproof plastic, although this can be annoying, rather like people who post threads begging for information without doing any research

Con:

* The Pebble 2 heart rate monitor works by running a small current through your wrist.  Some people have reported muscle spasms, causing them to slap people in the face when they ask stupid questions

* Pebble the company is no more, which means the guarantee has expired, rather like my patience with people who can't be bothered to take a moment to figure things out for themselves.

    const YEARS_PER_CENTURY = 100;
    const YEARS_PER_DECADE = 10;

    const WEEKS_PER_YEAR = 52;
    const DAYS_PER_WEEK = 7;
    const HOURS_PER_DAY = 24;
    const MINUTES_PER_HOUR = 60;
    const SECONDS_PER_MINUTE = 60;

Months per quarter?  Give me a break.  Look, all code is on a sliding scale from unintelligibly concise to confusingly verbose.  For me, this is too far towards the latter.  Constants are defined so that you can adjust them centrally, right?  But until we all lose our minds and decide to decimalise time the number of milliseconds in a minute isn't going to change, like, ever.  The only other reason would be clarity of code, which is easily achieved with comments, or indeed variable names.  Who the fuck wants to see:

    $msinyr = MILLISECONDS_IN_A_SECOND * SECONDS_IN_A_MINUTE * MINUTES_IN_AN_HOUR * HOURS_IN_A_DAY * DAYS_IN_A_WEEK * WEEKS_IN_A_YEAR;

when you can just put

    $milliseconds_in_a_year = 31557600000;

or

    $timeout = microtime() + 31557600000; // a year from now

If the number of days is going to change then of course that should be factored out *but not as a constant*.  If you're editing source code as part of your normal operations, you're doing it wrong.

Now, this also brings up another problem which is that multiplying all those constants together in my example will give you the wrong answer because there aren't precisely 52 weeks in a year.  So by defining all these constants you're actually just laying a big, fat trap for some poor sap to walk into when his mind is on other things.  By actually typing in the calculation you will go ""60 x 60 x 24 x oh wait should I put 365 or 365.25"" which engages your brain with the problem rather than concentrating on not mis-spelling your verbose constant names.

Okay, some people might not know there are 365 days in a year.  Or 91 days might not be obviously 13 weeks at a glance, and I've often put something like:

    $days = 9*7; // nine weeks

but if you can't do the mental maths to convert *years* to *decades* without having it spelled out to you, you're in the wrong job.  We have decimalisation *precisely because* multiples of ten are bleedin' obvious.  Be honest - a sixteen character constant name is no substitute for a single zero.
