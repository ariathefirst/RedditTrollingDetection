If a girl tells you she's on the pill, and you bang and gets pregnant, do you think you should be off the hook for child support?  Perhaps you disagree with fines for bars and bottle shops who sell to minors?

You don't have absolute control over others but if you have an interest in them being who they say they are and behaving how they promise to behave then you will sure as shit take more care over dealing with such people.

When you sell something privately you're only worrying about yourself - will this guy pay me, will I get a good price, whatever.  But if you're selling a gun then society at large also has a worry - is he going to shoot up a school?  If you have kids at a local school you'll be much twitchier about a miserable goth kid looking to buy .  But if you're childless then you might not think much of it because it doesn't affect you directly.  The threat of a conviction might just make you a bit more invested in a good outcome from the sale and make you more careful.

Those of us who work with potentially dangerous goods or people have to take some of the responsibility for reducing the danger.  Cool off periods and background checks are great but they're also box-ticking which I'm sure some unscrupulous retailers treat as an annoyance rather than a useful tool to help make society safer.  If they were perceived not as anti-business bureaucracy but as a tool to keep the gun dealer himself out of prison then they might be more effective.

In Australia, if you stumble drunk out of a bar and into the path of a car, *the bartender who last served you is partly liable*, because he had the chance to prevent you getting too wrecked to get home safely.  A mate of mine worked in a Sydney bar and he said that if a """"bucks night"""" (stag party) came in and even one of them acted too drunk, he'd bar them and then call every bar on the street to make sure they didn't accidentally serve the group either.

That is your language. I have no idea what you are talking about here. Because it makes no sense. 

Second, I agree that this is poorly drafted:

&gt; You acknowledge and agree that you and Airbnb are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding. 

To break it down:

&gt; You acknowledge and agree that you and Airbnb are each waiving (i) the right to a trial by jury or (2) to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding. 

I added the (i) and (ii) for clarity. But that is it. Personally, I would have used """"and"""" rather than """"or"""" to make this precise thing clear. 

However, that doesn't affect the fact that class action waivers, waivers of jury trials and agreements to binding arbitration are totally valid and binding and there is tons and tons and tons of caselaw to support this.

&gt; I certainly read it this way and this possibly set me off in the wrong direction thinking it is trying to preclude any court action whatsoever which is obviously not the case.

It **is** the case and it *works.* You have agreed to arbitration - and that is it. In fact, there is even [federal law stating that this is okay - The Federal Arbitration Act.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Arbitration_Act)

It was my first smartwatch, but the always on screen, water resistance, low price, and simplicity are what made me choose Pebble. I wondered if I would be better off with a newer model that had the color screen and microphone, but was happy enough with the classic. Then, three days in, I got the infamous screen tearing. Contacted support, and a week later they are sending a replacement. In the meantime, I started looking around, and decided to buy the standard Time. I don't want to deal with being without a watch for a couple weeks at a time if the screen tearing happens again, and figured the new features might be worth it. I've had the time for about three days now as well. Overall, I'd say it's a tough choice. The microphone works well, with the glaring exception of being able to dictate some names or local slang. The color display is nice, but honestly I went back to using the clock face I had on the classic (Modern), and don't even notice the color screen all that much when using apps. Pebble health is really nice however, and in my limited use seems better than both Misfit and Plexfit. That alone is nearly worth the upgrade. The microphone is nice, but I personally have limited occasions where it is appropriate to use, and have more than a couple friends whose names it cannot recognize. It feels much better on the wrist than the classic. Smaller, and with a more comfortable stock band. The buttons are a step backwards however. The smaller size means that there's no longer room for space between the 3 side buttons, and instead of instinctively being able to tell which one I'm pressing, I often second guess myself and have to look. They also don't press nearly as nice. The classic had a great snappy press with its buttons. The Time is much """"mushier"""". I can push it halfway down with some force, and then have to push even harder to get it to actually register. The classic was just a simple single pressure down with a satisfying click when it was pushed. Lastly, i feel as though the Time has more animations in 3.8 than the classic. They take more time and seem less polished than some of the hard cuts from one screen to anther on the classic. In particular i dislike the folding spiderweb transition when going back to your watch face. Overall though, I would say it's worth the upgrade to the Time, even if it's not for the 'major' features like a color screen and microphone. It's the comfort and Pebble health that really does it for me. Software can always be changed, and hopefully future generations of the Pebble can fix my gripes with the buttons. Good luck with your decision though! Hope I was able to help even with my limited time with both.

Edit: About the viewing angles: I can't compare them side by side since my classic Pebble is unusable with the screen tearing and I haven't gotten the replacement yet, but I haven't noticed a huge difference. I would agree that it's not quite as good, but nothing i probably would have noticed enough to complain about. The screen colors from just the backlight are pretty abysmal though. Normal daylight is great, but at night my reds become a very washed out magenta and the rest of the spectrum looks like pastels.

I speak okay French and in the end I only watched French films because:

a) Watching a film dubbed out of a language you're fluent in and into a language you struggle with is painful.  Turns out it's pretty easy to lip read under those circumstances and you end up having to look away from the character's faces.

b) Watching a film in English with foreign subtitles is super-awkward for pretty much the reason that you've already said.  You end up laughing very slightly out of sync with everyone reading the subtitles and sometimes at completely different times.  At first I didn't realise what was going on and it was really disconcerting.

c) I once watched a Chinese film subtitled into French.

4154,"&gt; We met Quentin Crisp, and he took us to the movies and drinks afterwards

Fucking hell, story time!",,pineapplecharm,2,t1_d2tk9sp,d2tlvyg,t3_4hxnis,t5_2qkog,1462441530,d2tk9sp,"I first visited NYC in 1988 (we had a week in Moscow, and thought a following week in NYC would make a great contrast - it did!) and you are spot on - I'd pictured a shining, gleaming metropolis and was shocked by the sheer decrepitude of so much of it. It was a different city back then - it changed dramatically block-by-block, even in Midtown. We walked from Battery City to Upper East Side one day and it was like walking across planet Earth. We met Quentin Crisp, and he took us to the movies and drinks afterwards. 

It's changed massively since, become more homogeneous, much safer. Last time I was there (2014) we sat drinking craft beer and eating fries with shaved truffle on the sidewalk on Frederick Douglass Bvd. I wouldn't have walked up there in 88.  

It's still creaky, grimy and very, very """"lived in"""" - which is its charm. The density is crazy, the speed is crazy, most of the people are at least a bit crazy. The Subway is utterly baffling to use, utilitarian, a little intimidating. The staff are hilarious. The 3 of us bought 3 travelcards and I asked if we could have 3 maps. """"No!"""" he snapped. """"You get one"""". There was no room for negotiation. That's what I love about the place - as a tourist, you have to fit in. They don't make any effort to sanitize the experience like in London. And, what's more, it's by far the most comprehensive mass transit system in the US. And it's very cheap. 

The roads are in a terrible state and always have been. The huge metal plates bolted onto the surface where repairs have become impossible. The Subway was built very shallow, which can't help, and neither does the extreme climates. For the world's premier city, it does indeed feel very ramshackle - but the US is predominantly scruffy and poorly maintained, with bubbles of immaculateness here and there. That even goes for super rich cities like San Francisco, let alone Baltimore. Airport-wise, JFK has improved massively (it used to be TERRIBLE! The duty free used to be a kiosk where you would choose from a catalogue, pay, and they'd bring the stuff to the plane. We were delayed once, and the only eating at 11pm was a Pizza Hut with pepperoni or plain cheese. And they'd run out of pepperoni. No booze at all). Last time we came back from EWR which was bland but clean, efficient, and the BA lounge superb. The cab drivers are rude and barely speak English (so I felt quite homesick!) but they are everywhere at every hour of the day. Never waited more than 3 mins, even in the small hours. 

It would be terrible if NYC became sterile and bland like so many sprawling US cities. I LOVE it to pieces and it's the only place on earth I would choose to live over London.

I can look at at a statue of Queen Victoria and know the immensely troubled history behind her Empire, of genocide and subjugation. I can also recognise the technological and societal leaps that were made under her rule. 

No one is innocent. Humanity's development has been propelled by conflict, injustice and suffering and quite frankly, by being bloody awful. It is a task for the minds of tomorrow to try and change that, little by little, as previous generations have before them.

They are on her level so she generally doesn't jump up at them but she will run circles about them, bump them on the butt and occasionally nip a heel. This kid came up behind Sabine, jumped and screamed at her, which startled my dog to turn around and jump at the kid which knocked the kid on to the sidewalk and caused him to get a cut on his head when it hit. 

I was freaking out. Thankfully I had a few witnesses so when the mom came huffing and puffing, I had a few other people point to the rules saying that no children under the age of 12 are allowed to be in the park at all.

1. Nutrition
2. Physical Comfort
3. Emotional Encouragement

First one is kinda easy. Figure out what she normally uses while training and bring some of that. Also bring some snacks that she likes to normally eat. Depending on weather, have ice or hot chocolate on hand. If you want to be a super star, have small portions of comfort food, so for me, a slice of hot pizza. You do have to be careful about how much you let them eat. And to get them back on the road.

For physical comfort, bring a spare change of clothes and a changing towel. It's cheap insurance in case of rain, gravel, dirt, etc. Aside from that, chammy butter and anti chaffing items are great. Also just some basic first aid stuff like anti itch cream. Wet wipes too! So that they can be clean if they want. A water jug big enough to actually wash hands and face are also great. 

And emotional comfort... just be encouraging. It sometimes sucks to be in a supporting role waiting hours just to see your partner for 5 minutes at a time. Bring enough stuff to keep yourself busy and happy. Because when you are unhappy, it can translates over to the rider which will sit in their minds. Ask them what they want to do, do they want to finish the ride. But don't force them, it has to be their choice and your role is to keep them grounded and remove unneeded stresses from them.

Bonus credit tidbit, when snacking from the giant bag of goodies you'll likely have, try to not eat the last of any given item. Obsessing over food is pretty common, and can be soul shattering when you arrive to not find it. I may or may not still hold a slight grudge at somebody who ate my cold, 6 hour old burger.

4404,"Not quite.  Thing is, a massive increase in business is fine, as long as it's at a profitable price point and it continues afterwards.  Plenty of businesses not only survive a massive rush but change gear and thrive on it.  The problem with Groupon was that it ticked neither of these boxes.  First, the massive rush was at 25% of the normal price (minimum discount 50%, then Groupon take half of what's left) so although you could get economies of scale they would have to be pretty drastic for you not to come out making a loss.  Even that would be surviveable, however, if you converted any of the new customers into long-term profitable prospects.  But the second problem with Groupon is that doesn't happen.  If the first time you come to the spa you're paying £25 for a massage, there is no way in hell you're coming back to get the same thing for £50.

If a big company has excess stock to shift, or needs to get its name out there with some kind of gimmicky one-off, Groupon might possibly work.  But, as their own repeat business was practically nonexistent with business owners realising quickly that it wasn't worth the effort, Groupon marketed themselves ever more aggressively onto tiny, boutique and hand-made style local businesses who just got flattened by the worthless demand.

The worst part is, the one tiny ray of light of getting all that money upfront (i.e. so you can actually buy all this bulk stock you're going to need) didn't exist - the business saw nothing without collecting valid coupon codes and typing them into Groupon's website.  This took a lot of time on top of everything else and also meant that every person who bought a Groupon and didn't cash it in was lining Groupon's pockets without benefitting the poor business owner who'd now maxed out her credit card buying in stock that wasn't getting paid for.

It's a diseased and horrible business model which they almost seem to have gone out of their way to make as toxic as possible.  Good riddance to them.",,pineapplecharm,3,t1_cvbeapz,cvbszx0,t3_3lxs5y,t5_2qgzg,1443041644,cvbeapz,"Many of Groupons business partners are not smart business people and they fumble with their Groupon partnerships.  

The service and reviews of groupons deals is very poor. Many times the business was totally overwhelmed, understaffed, and at times never communicated to their own employees that they launched a groupon. If you take a quiet spa or hair salon and suddenly increase demand 2000%, you're going to have some serious problems. You can't get people booked on time, you can't deal with the constant phone calls and walk-ins, service is rushed to accomoodate growing lines, staff is stressed tremendously and customer service fails. Meanwhile everyone who didn't get exactly what they wanted is bashing your business online and through word of mouth. Your brand is beng destroyed.   

Imagine you cook dinner for your family. It's a good meal, it's nice. Now imagine 800 people show up for dinner. You don't have the time, supplies, nor kitchen setup to accommodate.

4440,"I have to say,  I've heard some specious bullshit about motoring from Americans in my time but this is actually dangerous. The hand brake is designed to be applied when the car is stopped, to keep it stopped. Nothing more. As regards failure, modern cars have dual circuits hooked up to diagonal pairs of wheels so if one fails you still have at least some braking at the front. If there was any question of the so-called e-brake ever being used to stop the car it would be hooked up to the front wheels.

In the extremely unlikely event of total hydraulic brake failure, engine braking is a hugely superior strategy. Not only are many cars front wheel drive but, in those that aren't, you won't lock up the rear as the hand brake would do.

**If your brakes fail, hit low gear. This will slow the car enormously without robbing you of control.**

Edit: to be fair, both previous replies are probably be saying it's designed *in such a way that it would* work without the hydraulics, rather than deliberately *to* work in such a situation.  However, I'd still argue that if you pull on it and it works as designed, you're going to have a very bad day.

It's having the rug pulled out from underneath you. Going on the basis that any type of funding or employment could disappear without warning, no one would be having kids at all because it'd be a huge risk.

This paragraph in the article sums up the views of the author to me:

""""For starters, Claire and her husband won__ see their income __lummet_ when tax credits are cut. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that the maximum loss to any family from the changes next April will be £1,000 a year _ a big number for low-income families, yes, but hardly what most people would call __lummeting_. """"

£25k a year and losing around £80 to £100 a month is fucking devastating. I'd have struggled with that loss back when I was earning that much. Christ, rent in the capital was around £950 a month for me and my partner back when we were earning that much....who knows how much it is now?!

You'd get roughly (and I mean roughly) £1,674 a month after tax...they need a property big enough for 5 children and themselves so at least a 3 bedroom house to rent, in London, would be fucking impossible to afford...so let's assume they are spending something like £750 a month to live outside London somewhere, as a modest guess...that leaves them with about £900 a month, let's take off some bills....gas...leccy....at the cheaper end, £50 a month each if they're frugal? My utilities are more like £140 a month so I'm again being very modest with guessing...this leaves £800, then food....who knows what they are spending trying to hopefully eat healthily - I spend roughly £70 a week on food and it's just me, and my wife - no kids...let's say it's £50 a week and I'm just an anomaly (I'm really, really understating these figures)...they're left with £600 but the chances are at this point they're really left with like £300...then they have council tax...band C property at LEAST...modest guess again £140 a month....could be left with anywhere between £400 to £0 a month...who fucking knows...the point is...the kids need clothes, they need emergency funds, occasional dental work, all sorts of shit and I can already see how £25k isn't going to keep that family floating. And then they lose £100 of that monthly income to this shit...and we're not allowed to feel sorry for them or see this as bad?!

Anyway I'm just thinking out loud, there's loads of shit I haven't covered but this article approaches £25k for a family of 5 as a lot of money?! I know I'm forgetting her part time wage which will top it up but this article fucking pretends they're rolling in it.

And referring to her as """"Corbyn's friend"""" already tells me something about the bias this shit has bubbling under the surface. Perhaps they could have asked her what her monthly finances look like to get a better picture?

For example, any child could have easy access to a newspaper, but porn is typically restricted to the top shelves, with their covers hidden.

The fact that a woman is topless in a newspaper isn't the offensive thing, it's the fact that it's just part of the sexism that tabloid culture embraces as a whole. Take the Daily Mail, for example, which equally shames and publicises practically any woman with a bit of cleavage, while the red tops in particular have a total lack of any male equivalent.

It's just another ingredient in what effectively functions as a way of making women more self conscious whilst depicting them as caricatured objects for men's pleasure. The NMP3 campaign is basically trying to tackle just a small part of the problem, because this entire ideology is pretty hard to try and take down all at once.

My personal problem with page three is that I can't think of a solid reason why it should stay, as it's negatives far outweigh the positives. And in a society where we now have a constant flow of arousing material online, it's certainly not necessary by any means to feature it on the inside cover of a newspaper, and as a country, we won't be missing out by not having this """"staple"""" feature. Those that want to ogle at boobs everyday have plenty of outlets to do so for free, and I feel that their arguments for it to feature in this particular context fall flat as a result.

Full story: in 1997 I went to the RHPS *every* Friday night for about two months.  It was ridiculous but in my defence the show used to be amazing; each scene on screen was acted out very enthusiastically by real live people on the stage and if you were in the front row you'd get water / underwear / lab coats on you as a matter of course.  During *There's a Light* they would encourage people to unfold the newspaper from their prop pack to shelter from the staff squirting everyone with water pistols from the balcony.

Anyway, one night I went with rowdy school friends and decided to up the ante.  I wore my best drag outfit and a huge overcoat, underneath which was my little sister's full-on Super Soaker.  Pumping with adrenaline, I smuggled that thing right into the auditorium and, just as Brad and Janet were getting their bedraggledest, I leaped up out of my seat, pumped my weapon and let fly with a full on crowd-control water cannon barrage.

Unfortunately, in my drunken enthusiasm I had failed to inspect the balcony carefully and my ebullient hosing hit their high powered spotlight, causing a small cloud of steam and a distinct dimming of the light as the lens cracked.  Within seconds the ushers had rushed me, divested me of my sister's gun and escorted me from the auditorium.  Barely ten minutes into the film I found myself deposited back into Leicester Square alone, unarmed and in full Anne Summers style drag.

I waited about fifteen minutes before, realising my friends weren't coming, sloping off for a pint.  I'd love to say I was the centre of attention but when a skinny boy in a suspender belt orders a pint of Guinness at the Moon Under Water you'd be surprised at how wide a berth he gets.

This made me laugh.  My Dad once got stung for about £400 by a Volvo dealer for an oil change and you can definitely buy a car for that.

A short list of things people do that make no sense:  

* Buy a car without a thought to the cost of maintenance. I cannot tell you how many times I've seen this. In fact, it was gonna be lower on the list, but I bumped it to the top because people should see it, even if it's just one guy. When you buy a car, you should really consider how much it costs to maintain the damn thing. I used to change oil for a living and I can't tell you how many people would pull up in a $75,000 Mercedes or BMW then get mad when we told them their oil change was more expensive than an oil change for say, a Chevy Cruze. There's a reason, jackass. A Mercedes doesn't run the same oil weight or quantity that the aforementioned car does.  

* Drive them like morons. Seriously, there's a lot of talk about parts and service, but the absolute **WORST** thing people do to their cars is drive them like morons. Hitting every pot hole in the road, slamming on your brakes, jackrabbit starting^^1 , and racing around everywhere is hard on your car and will cost you a lot of money in the long run.

* Install HID's and do one of two things: Either install them in stock headlight housings (which is illegal and dumb as hell) OR don't point them correctly. HID's are far brighter than standard headlights and you should definitely do your research before you install them.  

* Ride on bald tires. Not even worn tires. Bald tires. Seriously, I've seen people riding on tires so bald you couldn't even tell what the tread pattern **used** to be. Some even had the bands showing.  

* Impatiently attempt to tint their own windows and end up with an army of tiny air pockets all over the back window. It's *really* obvious and you look like an idiot.  

* Buy cheap knockoff wheels because their price is much lower than the more expensive version they cloned. You get what you pay for when you buy wheels. Cheaper aftermarket wheels can be made of crappier materials, resulting in a shattered rim when you hit a pot hole hard enough. Obviously any rim can only take so much abuse, but the quality ones will last a lot longer.  

* Modify their cars then don't have them re-tuned. This is a big one for people who modify their cars. By changing the car's performance, you've nullified the factory tuning because it was done with stock parts in mind. You need to have the car's ECU re-tuned.^^2  

^^1 
&gt; Jackrabbit starting is when the light turns green and someone takes off at a much higher pace than it actually necessary for the flow of traffic. Not anywhere near racing necessarily, but far faster than you would normally start. It's one thing if you're in a hurry, but to do it all the time is terrible. Your car doesn't like that being done to it. It's much better to ease into the throttle and let the car accelerate at a reasonable pace.  

^^2
&gt; Re-tuning the ECU is reserved for more major part changes such as changing the camshaft, heads, fuel injectors (maybe), turbocharging/supercharging, etc. Changing an intake does not apply.

If there's a specific movie, I want to see, especially if it's a new one, then I'm often let down, this is true. This is the most often-heard complaint about Netflix. But knowing this, I just browse if I'm bored, to see if there's anything that seems interesting to watch. For that, Netflix is great, there's always interesting movies and such.

The best part about Netflix though is indeed tv shows. It keeps track of what episodes you've watched, where you've stopped watching, etc.

To use a weird example, if I need to use the bathroom while watching a tv show, I'll pause it and return to the main menu on my computer/tv, grab my tablet, and when I open netflix there, it's ready to resume where I left off. Take the tablet with me into the bathroom (there's a shelf there for reading materials, or tablets), watch the tv show while pooping, afterwards, pause the show on the tablet, hit """"refresh"""" on the tv/computer netflix and resume again.

It seems trivial, but that inter-device keeping track of tv shows is really great.

I do still pirate shows that I can't find elsewhere but when I have a choice, I use Netflix instead of pirating.

Interestingly, I also have HBO, including the HBO Go app/website, but that is such a steaming pile of shit that I still pirate shows like Game of Thrones, even though I can watch them legally through HBO Go. :)

for a final metaphore: switching from piracy to netflix is like getting a car when you're used to riding a bicycle (for context: I'm Dutch). You never *get rid of* the bicycle, it's still there, and for some trips, it's better (like going downtown). But it's just so much easier to just grab the car and if you have both, that's what you'll end up doing most often.

The metaphore doesn't stop there: when you only have a bike, you might go to the hip, new downtown places often. You'll think: well, if I get a car, I'll still go there, but just use the bike like I have. But you don't. Once you have that car and are used to the ease and luxury, you'll find yourself going downtown less often and instead not mind going to other places, that sometimes are a tad uglier and old-fashioned (suburban supermarkets/malls) but are just fine and have free parking. 

That's what Netflix does too. It's so easy to start up a movie that might be one or two years old but still sounds interesting and you haven't seen yet, that you'll find yourself doing that more often than surfing the torrents for the very latest flick.

That said, I did see The Interview a few days before it was digitally released. I still *have* my bicycle, and when something is interesting enough, I don't mind firing it up. :)

They can carry out more instructions in given clockspeed since they are simpler. However, because they are simpler, that means that you often need multiple instructions to equate a single CISC instruction. That being said, that does allow for more flexibility in optimization, hence where the efficiency claim comes from. For example, x86 will often copy numbers in registers to and from memory automatically before and after an instruction. Its easier to write and saves RAM. Whereas, in ARM, you have to explicitly tell the processor to do this but you don't need to if it isn't necessary, so you save CPU cycles. Anybody that has has done real work with x86/ARM assembly will probably scoff at the huge generalization, but its the gist of it.

Either way, that's why comparing clockspeed is a poor choice in RISC vs CISC. They are entirely different design philosophies and each have their own strengths.

5081,"I was once leaving a real ale beer festival after a long afternoon drinking things with names like """"Dr Gutrot's Stygian Stench Stout"""".  Happily refreshed, my forward planning was not at its peak as I crowded into an underground train along with the thronging masses of tipsy brew enthusiasts, and it did not occur to me to effect a tactical evacuation of the nascent gas bubble forming in my nether regions before embarking.

Three stops in and the enormity of my mistake became apparent. The growling in my pipework was getting harder to ignore and the pressure at the gates was mounting with every jolt.  I faced a vexing dilemma: I wanted desperately to hold on until my destination but with four stops to go and an appreciable increase in stress with every passing moment I knew this was not without risk.  I toyed with the idea of a one-cheek puff which might relieve enough pressure to enable me to survive the journey but that would require the kind of sphincter control normally associated with a flautist's lips and not the ravaged, spent bunghole that thirty years of curry and Guinness had won me.

Reader, I gambled.  I knew I could do it.  I'm not a child; I know all the tricks.  I clenched and I moved about.  I leaned against the wall.  I sat awkwardly on that little bench thing by the door, one cheek squeezed up against the other, so my entire upper body weight was employed in a pressure retention operation that would have impressed the guys that put up the Hoover Dam.  Two stops went by.  Three.  Then a jolt pulling out of the fourth nearly dislodged me from my seat.  I managed to hold on but definitely felt the tiniest mosquito's cough sneak out between my terrified cheeks.

I tried to quell the panic and gripped the bars, bracing to see if it stank enough for the thronged crowds to notice.  There was nothing.  Briefly.  Then Mr Hankey's gay flatmate burst in, viciously stuck his erect shit-cock up my nose and flooded my sinuses with bum gas.  Dear God.  For so much of my life I'd been under the blissful impression that one's own effluent was less offensive than others' and yet this, this tiny forward scout of the massed army assembling in what felt like the entire length of my poor gut, was so pungent, so powerful, so downright radioactive that every hair in my nostrils stood on end, saluted and died instantly.  I choked back vomit as my eyes flooded with tears and, before I could take control of my muscles, reflexively opened my mouth.  This was the tipping point.

Smelling a fart is one thing.  To taste it, dear reader, is to see God in all His wrath.  Millennia of evolution had tried its hardest to punish my ancestors into avoiding getting even one molecule of excrement into the front end of my digestive system and now my brain was flooded with signals that I had just bitten into a double-strength Mississippi shit cake.  It was too much, and in all the excitement my ringpiece gave up the ghost.

Have you ever been to the zoo?  Have you heard the angry, glottal roar of an injured lion, echoing into a concrete pen?  Imagine such a sound but played in reverse.  There was no initial explosion, but rather a soft growl that grew in waves as a feedback system meant the increasing foulness of the stench flowing to my face brought me closer to a catastrophic failure of arse-seal.  For five long seconds the trumpeting of an approaching horde of randy elephants built and echoed through the carriage, causing those nearest me to turn in amusement.

""""Sew a button on that,"""" cried one wag.

Another: """"Speak up, Brown; you're through!""""

""""One more turn and she would've started!""""

""""A confident appeal by the Austral..."""" the fourth was cut short.

It is an oft-quoted """"fact"""" that placing a frog in cold water and slowly bringing it to the boil can cause the hapless amphibian not to notice it is being cooked alive.  No such luck for those on the 23:24 from Earls Court that fateful Summer evening.  The white heat of the offensive hit them suddenly and irreversibly, fogging up glasses and bleaching delicate fabrics as it flooded through the enclosed space like a fire through a 1970s variety club dressing room.  Witticisms were replaced by gutteral exclamations. """"Gas, boys; Gas!"""" cried one as he floundered for the other end of the carriage, clawing at the other passengers in a vain attempt to escape Turd Zero.  But even those who did break from the door-bound throng suffered a cruel irony - their very movement agitated the smell and brought it with them, poisoning the very fresh air they sought to reach.

As the panic reached its peak, the train slowed and, through the tears in my stinging eyes, I perceived the doors spring open.  I launched myself out of the train, certain that the grasping hands were my fellow travellers effecting an attempted arrest as a precursor to exacting a terrible revenge on the poisoner of their journey.

But as I staggered out into the fresh night air, no such retribution came.  I turned and looked at the carnage inside, the torn newspapers and trodden-on hats, the glasses all askew and the woman dry retching into her handbag.  And it hit me - *they were so preoccupied with survival they didn't know who the culprit was*.

I paused, blood rushing back to my face, and smoothed down the front of my shirt.  The doors were beeping shrilly, faint wafts of my epic trouser disaster puffing clouds against the clear night sky.

""""TWAS I, YOU FOOLS,"""" I cried as the doors slid shut on their mobile prison.  """"AND I'D DO IT AGAIN IN A FARTBEAT.""""

5172,"&gt; Google wouldn't be liable for the emotional damage

I feel like the whole point of OP's post is that it's the *guilt* rather than the actual financial liability that's bothering them.

It all comes down to practicality; what's worth fixing and what *can* be fixed, and the difference between one's own paranoia and the pragmatism of others is often stark.

I once misplaced a decimal on a set of alloy wheels, marking them down from £740 to £74 per set of four.  The first I knew about it was when £10,000 worth of them had been ordered overnight.  Legally, in the UK, if you've accepted money you have to deliver the goods and I shat a brick, convinced I'd be liable for a hundred grand's shortfall in revenue.

God bless the guy at the warehouse who painstakingly called each customer and told them the only fitment we had left was Renault 2CV ([three hub bolts](http://www.2cvcity.co.uk/new-road-wheel-15-inch-painted.html), who knew?) and """"generously"""" gave them all full refunds.  We pre-authorised after that, and had to manually approve each order before we took the money.",,pineapplecharm,1,t1_dhn3t8o,dhn78ge,t3_6bheco,t5_2qs0q,1494965815,dhn3t8o,"&gt; Conversely, imagine if Google maps, a free service, sent you 200 miles off course and made you miss a funeral.

Well, at least in that case, Google wouldn't be liable for the emotional damage. But this is the idea. I've worked on a few projects where there was quite a bit of potentially irreversible damage - we handled emotionally valuable data, and losing or mutilating that data would have been much worse than billing someone for $5 and having to issue a refund.

Another example from my own experience is from a car rental firm, where a colleague implemented a new system for importing traffic fines electronically, automatically matching them to customers, and billing them accordingly; he fucked up a little, we didn't notice until 3 months later, when the overdue notices started coming, and we ended up having to write off _30,000 worth of traffic fines we no longer had the data to match them to the offending customers.

And on the other side of things; I worked on a custom-built web shop once that was a nightmare of a legacy mess, and it had billing bugs that we knew about, but couldn't fix because the fix would have required changing the entire application architecture, data model, code, everything, and that would have introduced a hundred more bugs. However, the web shop operated in a line of business with insane profit margins; they'd routinely hand out 30% discounts and still make a profit. Meaning that these bugs, which caused something like 1% of orders to be shipped but never billed, were considered perfectly acceptable; the bugs that caused orders to be billed twice were considered even less of a problem, because either the customer would notice, and you'd give them a refund (which was about 30 seconds work), or they wouldn't, and you'd happily cash in twice. What did make me nervous on that project however was the fact that there were no backups, and a single rogue `DELETE` query could have killed the company overnight.",,tdammers,2,t1_dhn0kfj,dhn3t8o,t3_6bheco,t5_2qs0q,1494962101,0.545466,0.276609,0.07323,0.054505,0.243319,0.108897,0.633818,0.115762,0.553916,0.100461,0.20098,-0.715684,0.13893668,0.42247987

5185,"Argentina and the UK had actually (at the behest of the UN) been discussing at very least co-governance, if not transfer to Argentina entirely, since the sixties.  The islanders, however, weren't keen and the UK government was loathe to treat its own citizens, however barren and far away their home, so poorly as to give away their land from under them.

Argentina, pissed off at the lack of progress, fancied the islands back.  They knew the islands didn't have much going on by way of defences and, while you're right and they knew the UK wouldn't be a pushover in person, they also knew that actually showing up to the party was going to be a massive ballache for the Brits and gambled that they wouldn't bother.

Of course, Thatcher grasped the opportunity to be a war Prime Minister with both hands.  The Argentine army had the opportunity at that point to withdraw but I am guessing they figured they had the advantage of being there first, a good stock of fast attack jets all ready to go, and of course the lethal, ship-sinking Exocet missiles from France.

However, even these advantages were eroded by (a) the longest bombing run in history at that point, involving planes to refuel planes to refuel the bombers (seriously, look it up - it was insane) which damaged the runway too much for the jets to take off and (b) one of the sneakiest bits of espionage outside of a James Bond film, where Mi5 tied up all the Exocets they could find in bogus deals which never went through, but kept the missiles from being sold to Argentina.

Once the actual soldiers showed up the conscript Argentine soldiers had already had enough.  History, being written by the winners, does not give a clear picture of whether the Belgrano was actually retreating, and it's entirely possible that the British forces had travelled too far, and staged too impressive a Vulcan attack, simply to shake hands and go home again.

One I was thinking about the other day is language. What if the official language of the EU changes? In the short term it would be a pain but German (for example) is the native tongue of almost 100 million of the 420 million and widely spoken in places like Poland, Alsace, northern Italy.

If it becomes a requirement that you need to operate in German to work on an EU-funded science project then British workers are fucked. Virtually no one leaves our school system being good at German and also good at science. You would have to do Biology, Chemistry and German for A levels which is just really unusual.

Now all this might be ok if the things with which we're replacing the EU were positive. Let's look at them:

- sovereignty. We may end up getting more bent over in order to get the trade deals we need. For instance we can't say no to a US trade deal even though in the past they've pushed for letting companies sue governments in secret courts, massive copyright and patent expansion and access to our healthcare market. We could end up having to say yes.

- fish. The fish are caught by mainly British crews then processed by staff who are almost entirely East European. Those people may be gone in 2019 and good luck getting school leavers to gut fish. The catch is mostly sold to Europe and may become uncompetitive when tariffs are priced in. The whole industry is heavily subsidised and that may go. If we don't agree a deal we may see a fish war with both sides overfishing the stock so the others don't get them. So many delicate parts any one of which could destroy the industry.

- Immigration control. Overall immigrants add GDP, this is a net loss, possibly a big one. Controlling immigrants will make most of us poorer.

&gt; I don't think he was far enough in front for the driver to see him

Yes, we are in agreement.  I was just picking up on your previous comment saying

&gt; Not sure how you can miss the danger

because I can totally see how """"I'm in front"""" can subconsciously be equivalent to """"I'm safe"""" if you don't realise that it doesn't necessarily mean the driver behind can see you.

We all undertake stationary traffic all day long and, while some may briefly overtake again when the light goes green, there's no question of hanging back behind every vehicle, particuarly when stopped. A left indicating bus, when you don't know how long you have to get through? Obviously a bad move.  But in this case, the truck is heading straight on, there's loads of room in the left turn lane... I can totally empathise.

Doesn't make the cyclist in the right, I just don't think he was quite as unreasonable as his adrenaline-fuelled, post-near-death experience screaming might suggest.  Hopefully lesson learned; I know for sure I'll be that bit more paranoid about it.",,pineapplecharm,2,t1_djsw3ea,djswc84,t3_6l98e3,t5_2qkog,1499249876,djsw3ea,"&gt; that would not be the cyclist's fault, right?

I agree with that. Happened to me before and scared the shit out of me.

&gt; So where's the line between that, and what happened here?

I think that this situation is much more similar to undertaking than the one you are describing. The cyclist may have briefly been in front of the lorry when setting off but I don't think he was far enough in front for the driver to see him, let alone say the driver overtook him and then cut him off.

I think we're not disagreeing here. My point really was that there is so much about dangers of HGVs and their blind spots in the media and signs at the back of the lorries (although, admittedly this one didn't have one) that, even if you're an inexperience cyclists, the risks were very obvious.

Yes, there are forced marriages. I'm not claiming that there aren't. I'm saying that the Western idea is wrong that an """"arranged marriage"""" is necessarily a forced marriage.  
  
For non-forced arranged marriages (which is a lot of them) it's more like, the parents and families act like a kind of dating app. They bring together various people who they think would be suited, and then the prospective bride and groom make a decision.  
  
The thing about this process is that conversations can get serious quickly. You don't have to wait for 20 dates before asking about kids, for example, or sharing money. You KNOW you're looking for a spouse, so you can get to those details right away.  
  
This man (or woman) would like to start a family right away. This man (or woman) wouldn't. This guy would prefer a wife who stays home. This guy would expect you to have a job.
