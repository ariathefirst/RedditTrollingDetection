One of them gets cancer - The long term healthcare costs, treatment, drugs all covered by the NHS. All in patient care covered by general taxation. Getting cancer is just bad luck, so we should all shoulder the burden of the costs of it as a common good for society.

Say now that same person got dementia instead; The long term healthcare costs would be deducted from the estate value instead, some drug costs are covered by the NHS, but most of the social care isn't. 

Say that person after 10 years of cancer or dementia then dies.

If they had cancer, the surviving spouse can remain in the same house, and maybe sell it to fund their own care by downsizing to somewhere smaller. They can then pass on this estate to any surviving children.

If they had dementia, the surviving spouse will only have £100,000 left from the estate because the care costs have swallowed the rest of the house value.

&gt; The concept of the alpha wolf is well ingrained in the popular wolf literature at least partly because of my book """"The Wolf: Ecology and Behavior of an Endangered Species,"""" written in 1968, published in 1970, republished in paperback in 1981, and currently still in print, despite my numerous pleas to the publisher to stop publishing it. Although most of the book's info is still accurate, much is outdated. We have learned more about wolves in the last 40 years then in all of previous history.

&gt;One of the outdated pieces of information is the concept of the alpha wolf. """"Alpha"""" implies competing with others and becoming top dog by winning a contest or battle. However, most wolves who lead packs achieved their position simply by mating and producing pups, which then became their pack. In other words they are merely breeders, or parents, and that's all we call them today, the """"breeding male,"""" """"breeding female,"""" or """"male parent,"""" """"female parent,"""" or the """"adult male"""" or """"adult female.""""

5569,"My credit card issuer is my only supplier that charges me commission based on the gross transaction value, because the service *is* the gross amount.  But that's different because the end user gets a VAT invoice from me explaining what proportion of what they're paying is tax.

The difference here is that Uber are the ones issuing the invoice.  If they are reselling the drivers' services, they owe VAT.  If they are collecting money on behalf of the drivers, they should be listing the VAT amount and the driver's VAT number and, which is my point, charging the drivers a percentage of the ex-VAT amount, not the gross amount.

I'm sure very few Uber drivers are turning over £83,000 (the maximum you can take in a year without collecting VAT) but if there is even one, and Uber's system doesn't issue the correct paperwork, Uber will have quite a time of it defending themselves.

Now I just have a sample list of several generic questions -around a particular pattern the candidate likes, or asking them to explain the benefit of a certain pattern. 
The more important part is getting them to talk about what they are working on at the moment, any problems they have had and getting to know them as a person.

Ask about:

* What are you working on at the moment. Use this to follow up on the technology they use, what made them choose library X, what was their role in the team

* How they deal with conflict. I find this one vital . You don't want someone too scared to raise things, you also don't want a loose cannon. How do they escalate issues? Do they take ownership of issues, etc.

* What their least favorite part of the job is, what is their least favorite language or library. Follow up with asking why, alternatives  they consider better etc


Problem is some people can just retain technical information, or be bullshitters. Getting them to talk about their projects means you can touch on the technology they use, as well as attained what sort of person they are and what relationship they have with their current collegues. We have rejected some really intelligent guys based on this who we later found out (through mutual friends) was arrogant and had a problem with authority.


It took me several interviews to perfect this and I am still improving, but we haven't hired a bad person in a long time since we stopped making it purely tech focussed.


The way we see it is that we would rather have the right person, and you can always provide more training or get rid of them if they blatently lied. It's harder to get someone to change their attitude.

We're not seeing the """"death of the living room"""" at all.

A specific subset of individuals that are either poor or at the beginning of their careers in a highly in demand city are choosing a smaller space because they'd rather treat their house as a place to sleep and enjoy life otherwise.

Regulation forcing certain rooms to not be used as bedrooms just pushes up prices across the board because you've reduced supply.

I borrow £10 from Steve.

I borrow £10 from Shirley.

I'm repaying you all back at a rate of £1 a week, so as long as I have £3 a week to spend on repaying you all, everything is fine.

Now imagine that for some reason you want me to repay you early, after only three weeks.  I still owe each of you £7 but I don't have an income stream, and I spent £9 on a """"Shitposter General"""" branded hat so let's say I only have £12 to my name.

If you get nervous that I'm never going to make any money and decide you just want what you can get, you can sue for me to go bankrupt and have my assets divided among everyone to whom I owe money.  So you, Steve and Shirley would get £4 each.  But maybe Steve and Shirley don't want the money right now.  They believe that if they wait long enough they'll get their full £10 back.  So nobody makes me bankrupt because even though it might suit them, it would screw over everyone else.

Now what happens if the reason you want early repayment is because you're struggling to make payments on your own loan from Janet?  If Janet makes *you* bankrupt, your loan to me is an asset which now needs to be liquidated to make payment to Janet.  But Janet, now, would be screwing over Steve and Shirley even though they have nothing to do with her.

The situation is now that nobody in the chain can go bust without massive wider consequences.  I don't really have to make payments on my loans because I can just whine to my creditors that they'll damage society at large if they wind me up, and I will *totally* pay them eventually, just not right now.

5660,"Retail is funny.  On the one hand, 5% sounds like very little to the untrained ear. On the other hand, 5% of a £240,000 house sale is good money even if you make nothing for weeks beforehand.  Likewise, £4 doesn't sound like a lot, and 5% of £4 is only 20p, but on the other if you literally have a queue all day and are taking £4 every thirty seconds that's nearly twenty five quid an hour.

Until you get there you just don't know how much business you're going to do, and hence how well you will be paid.  The percentage, and the individual item value, aren't enough information to ascertain this.  So yeah, in a small way you're justified in your paranoia that people might twig that you're not the most experienced sales agent in London.  That said, a """"queue all day"""" is extremely unlikely, and for every hour that's busy, you're sandbagging against the quiet hours, 11am on a Tuesday for example, when nobody's doing anything, and those times will drain your average earnings relentlessly.

One thing of which you can be certain is that the kind of people who make money employing people to sell dirt-cheap fried snacks to tourists for £4 a pop aren't doing so because they are enlightened employers.  They do know how busy it will be, and they are offering the absolute bare minimum required to make sure their stall is staffed.  Whatever the numbers, you almost certainly will not get rich selling churros at Winter Wonderland, pretty much by definition.  In a way I'd be *more* suspicious if they were offering 20%.

Minimum wage, however, is just that: a minimum.  If they offer you minimum wage OTE, that's not legal.  I do a few retail events where we pay minimum plus 10% commission, usually around a hundred a day extra, but that minimum is absolutely above minimum wage.  The whole point of being a business owner is that you take the risk, not your staff.

Yeah mine is Verifone which charges about 3.95%

What happened is last year TfL increased the starting meter price from £2.40 to £2.60 and this was supposed to cover the cost of the card commission. Bit of a strange choice because it meant that customers were effectively paying a card surcharge even if they chose to pay by cash, but whatever. It's not a make or break situation and i'm just happy to provide the card facility to passengers as long as the commission is reasonable.

&gt; How common is it for cabbies to own their cabs vs rent them?

Really not sure on the statistics to be honest but i'd imagine it's fairly even. The running costs actually work out not that different when comparing owning vs renting.

The new electric taxis will cost something in the region of £55,000

&gt; Why do some cabbies have 15 year old cabs still on the road?

15 years is the maximum age limit for a cab to be used for work. Once a cab exceeds 15 years you can still use it for driving about/leisure but not for work.

I THINK there might be some kind of exemption whereby you can get an engine upgrade or something to show that the emissions output has been improved but I really don't know so don't quote me on that!

&gt; Can you tell us what % of your rides are paid for by card vs cash?

Every day it varies quite a lot. I have some days where it can be 90% cash and others 90% card so it's difficult to say, but on the whole cash probably makes up about 30-40% total. The remaining 60-70% on card is actually mostly through mytaxi and Gett. Those apps make up about 40-50% of my work and most jobs are paid by card (on an account through the app). The remaining card work just comes from passengers off the street or station ranks were most passengers still prefer paying by cash.

&gt; What is your favourite lunch/snack spot?

Oh man that would be telling!

Sometimes on a busy night i'll park up in the outer circle of regents park and just catch my breath for a bit. It's really close to the west end so super easy to get to. At night there's a really quiet and calm ambience there so just makes a change from all the frantic noise, lights and traffic. You can easily do 6 hours in the cab without realizing and then it catches up with you so it's very important to get a good break now and then.

One of the best things about the job is just never knowing where you're going to end up. A couple weeks back I had a job down to Catford, it was a lovely sunny day so I just decided to lie down in the middle of Dulwich park for a few hours.

Favourite snack spot of our customers strangely seems to be the Chelsea Tea Hut at the south side of Chelsea Bridge. For some reason the wealthy young arabs of knightsbridge can't seem to get enough of it! I mean it's literally just a tea hut doing burgers but whatever. Probably due to just being open 24/7

&gt; Nicest celeb you__e picked up?

Frankie Dettori! An absolute legend and really nice guy, Arsenal fan too.

&gt; Strangest passenger?

Too many to mention but here's a few off the top of my head:

Russian guy on the Crystal Palace one way system. Had an """"al pacino in taxi driver"""" mohawk-style haircut and was wearing some kind of military gear. The dude was completely off his face, spent the whole journey yelling at me to go faster because the police were coming, it was 4am in the suburbs of south london and there were no cars around.

One guy got in off Edgware Road and instead of telling me where he wanted to go just barked seemingly random directions at me every 5 seconds """"left!"""" """"right!"""" """"straight!"""" etc. We actually went in a circle at one point. He offered no explanation and got out 10 minutes later just a short walk from where I originally picked him up.

A young spoiled brat in the kensington and chelsea area screaming down the phone to her parents because she didn't get enough allowance money to pay for an expensive knightsbridge restaurant so had to walk out without paying the bill. You really see the wealth inequality of London warts and all doing this job.

Driving extremely unsavoury characters around the backstreets of Harlesden at about 4am had me very on edge. At that time of the night people can switch easily so you've got to gauge their temperament well and try to keep them on your side.

Saudi chap asked me to park and wait on Edgware Road late at night while he got his shopping. Then stood around on the pavement for half an hour with the meter running, smoking and talking to me about life in England. Asked me if I could take him and his wife to either Liverpool, Cambridge, Stonehenge or Amsterdam the next day (he couldn't make his mind up which one lol). I gave him my number and said to give me a call but it never happened.

Interestingly I find you actually get a lot more trouble and bad behaviour from the more wealthier/professional/white collar types when they've had a bit too much to drink (it's usually the blokes). They let themselves go a bit too much, whereas working class and ethnic minority Londoners are usually always impeccably behaved and polite on a night out.

&gt; What do you think about the new electric cabs being marketed as the future?

I think it's fantastic, just like the credit card thing though, it should have happened years ago. Still better late then never. Admittedly I am anxious to find out more about the running costs, battery etc but it's for the best. I suffer from mild asthma so I really have no interest in breathing diesel fumes like this for the rest of my life. What concerns me though is the lack of infrastructure in place for them. They're going on the road later this year and I haven't seen any charging points. I don't have a driveway and don't live on the ground floor so in theory i'm going to have to run a plug extension cable out of my window down to the ground floor and charge up my cab, it doesn't really make sense.",,Cabologist,47,t1_dnd6x3c,dne6m4t,t3_71smpc,t5_2qkog,1506165038,0.27439,0.055367,0.036734,0.38625,0.414886,0.70232,0.536211,0.541132,0.174349,0.086247,0.160536,-0.0490668,0.22386143,Error!

The British style is more prosaic, meaning we like to sound credible and educated by referencing well-known literary phrases or using slightly unusual words that carry the precise connotations we wish to convey.  The idea is to communicate subtly that we've thought about the matter deeply and chosen a precise word.

The German attitude is to take the first word that means what you want to say, and use it.  The enthusiasm for portmanteau bolted-together nouns comes from a similar place; why invent a new word for """"seal"""" when *seehund* (literally """"sea-dog"""") says what you need?

""""The British government seems to enjoy empty discussion as much as it lacks strategic focus"""" would have been something I'd expect to read in *The Economist* but """"lacks a clear concept despite talking a lot"""" sounds more like an ADHD child's school report.

Can you point me at the paragraph this is in?  I'm being slow and can't find it.  Everyone's, rightly, pointing out that the CEL might indicate a number of non-essential problems and that it's an unfair blanket requirement which seems strangely draconian.  By contrast I did find this:

&gt; The dashboard warning lamp for these systems may take various forms and a vehicle should only be failed where the tester is certain that the warning lamp is indicating an ESC malfunction. This may require reference to the owners handbook if one is available.

Advisories are being replaced with minor fails. You will still get a pass but they will be noted on your test certificate. These are pre written and approved by the DVSA.

Those of you who have changed your standard headlight bulbs for HID's will now get a major fail even if the aim is correct. It has always been an offence to fit HID bulbs to halogen headlamps so the MOT is now in line with that.

Reverse lights are now part of the MOT for any car registered from 1st September 2009 (59 plate onwards). Daytime running lamps (DRL's) &amp; front fog lamps must work on vehicles registered from March 2018 (18 plate onwards).

Engine Management Light is now a major fail. It must come on with the ignition and then turn off when the engine is started.

Brake pad warning lights are a major fail.

Handbrake with excessive travel is now a major fail. Before it would only a fail if there was no reverse travel.

Contaminated (dirty) brake fluid is a major fail.

Oil leaks (engine, gearbox etc) can be a major fail.

A vehicle fitted with a DPF that emits any kind of visible smoke during the metered test will now fail.

Emissions limits for diesels registered on or after 1st of January 2014 have been reduced. All diesels will now need to pass the limit that was set by the manufacturer when the car was new. This can be found on the VIN plate. For example the current limit for your diesel car may be 1.50. That could change to as low as 0.30 with the new rules.

People steal, is it news when someone gets caught robbing?  Excluding someone from a restaurant because of their sexuality is against the law, so the person who """"said so out loud"""" was at very best inciting someone to commit a crime.  I'd say that was news.

Once we were at the window, of course, it felt gauche not to do the same so I picked a horse in a rush just for its name - """"Mr Aviator"""" to match my sunglasses - and put on £5 """"each way"""", because that left me another £5 to get home and there's less chance of losing because you get reduced odds for a 2nd or 3rd place finish.  Unfortunately, I didn't know that """"£5 each way"""" means £5 to win and £5 for the other two places.  Even through the booze I was gripped with horror as I realised that would completely clean me out for the day.  Still, I wanted to get laid so I coughed up my train fare and we rejoined the group.

Now it must be said that the guys who'd been betting all afternoon had been taking plenty of opportunity to crow about how much they knew about betting, and 'the form', and the state of the ground, etc, and if I've ever been mansplained to it was by these twats, who were taking every opportunity to tell me what slips, and odds, and """"expected gain"""" meant.  I think the bravado had taken on a life of its own and they'd all over-spent on the afternoon trying to impress each other, and me, and while I have to admit I was surprised by the lack of success I certainly felt they deserved it for being dicks.  However, as they'd started to run out of money their attention was wandering from the racetrack and as I returned with the young lady I found one of them very brashly elbowing his way into the conversation.  My first instinct was to try and repel him but, I won't lie, I was kind of hoping I could nudge him into offering her a drink, which would buy me another half an hour or so before I had to come up with a sudden excuse to leave because I literally couldn't afford a glass of cheap Chardonnay at that point.

I stood there and tried to bat him off just enough without bringing things to a head, when in the background I heard it.

""""Mr Aviator challenging on the outside...""""

I looked down at my ticket.  It said 33-1.  I looked down the raceway and, sure enough, the fucker was right on the inside, poking up next to the race leader with his jockey low down and strangely still.  It was like the pivotal scene in an eighties movie as the gambler smarmed up to the girl in front of me while, over his shoulder, the pack came thundering down towards us.

That glorious equine bastard crossed the line first by barely a head.  I have never heard such a sound as that tannoy - """"and it's Mr Aviator, Mr Aviator followed by-"""" by """"who gives a shit"""", and """"I am off to the bar"""" in third.

""""Sorry mate,"""" I said to the gambler, literally interrupting him by sticking my bet slip right in his smug face. """"Was this the *winner* in that race?""""  I showed it to another guy who had also been a rude cock.  """"Is 33-1 good odds then?  Did I win something?""""  Their faces were a torment of envious hatred.  Fuck, it was delicious.

I left, with the girl, and went to pick up the winnings: £230.  On a whim, I went upstairs and bought two bottles of champagne on ice at £60 each.  Screw it, easy come, easy go.  And watching those fucks take my wine and thank me for it was worth twenty times what I paid.

It could have been an absolute classic case of a toxic early win but, somehow, every time I thought of that day I would remember those other guys, with their empty posturing and drained wallets.  I got the girl's number but she cancelled our first date and we never met again.

I feel that was a good analogy.",,pineapplecharm,7,t1_drg5zp2,drhivek,t3_7kp0kq,t5_3j2jr,1513713573,drg5zp2,"On a perfect 50/50 odds, a Martingale strategy is fine (you'll break even over time on average)...

When I was about.. 19 or so, I was looking to replace my 1982 Hyundai S-coupe. So, with my monthly pay packet I went and bought a used Porsche 928.

I managed to get my insurance company to switch my insurance at no extra cost for the last month of it and though I'd arrived. Now granted it was old, a bit battered and all the rest of it, but it was a Porsche and it was mechanically sound...  Sadly, my insurer decided that on renewal, the premium would have to increase rather a lot more than I could afford (funny that). 

So I stuck it in storage hoping to sell it and pick up something else. Turns out storage is pretty expensive too, so after about 6 months of not being able to find a buyer, I offered it to the storage company in lieu of payment.  No more Porsche for me.

I didn't let that put me off though, this time I spent a bit of time with the autotrader (paper version at the time..) looking to see what nippy and smart looking used car I could afford.  I continued with my flash, but old, approach since it seemed to offer the best bang for buck..

So wind forward a month or so, and I managed to find a Mazda RX-7 (with a rotary engine..) for sale in Warrington *and* an insurer who would cover me for less than half my monthly income.  So I got a mate to give me a lift down, got to the garage, looked the car over and it was in pretty decent condition. It sounded nice, IIRC the electrics were a bit knackered and some of the  seals looked a but dubious, and there was  a bit of rust, but it had been freshly MOT'd and, well, I liked the look of it and it went fast so..

I handed over my cash and we both got in for the drive back west.  Happily I decided to fill up the car in Warrington rather than later, so I pulled into a petrol station about 2 minutes from the garage, filled up, walked in to pay.  

When I came out, there was a puddle under the car, not a small puddle, but basically the whole care was sitting on a massive pool of petrol.  Looking under the car, there was fuel literally pissing from around the fuel tank.  Now it hadn't been doing that before so I was a tad confused.

The petrol station staff were obviously a bit pissed off with me at that point, the car had stopped leaving, but there were about 30l of petrol covering the petrol station forecourt at that point..  I'm obviously also pissed off, although at the guy who had just sold me the car.  So I grab my mate out, we push the car clear of the petrol and drive back to the garage, which has cunningly now closed. Except the guy is still in the little shack..

Long story short, I have a bit of a row with the guy about him taking the piss selling a car he knew to be knackered and he spends a lot of time saying I should have checked first.. After about 10 minutes of that (and him suggesting he could fix the perforated fuel tank - because obviously he knew the issue existed... for about the price of the car) we managed to get him to hand back all the cash and take back the car.

Spare the drought, spoil the tree.",,pineapplecharm,109,t1_dnzovuu,dnzr895,t3_74na6p,t5_2qh0u,1507300869,dnzovuu,"If you look at the way they fell, it's a clue. The roots hit the road bed (which can extend a foot or more under the surface) and turn sideways into softer, richer soil. If this happens for long enough, you end up with a tree with no roots on one side, so it's much more likely to fall the other direction in a storm.

If you can make a circle of material with diameter 12 ft while flat on the ground, then there must be some perimeter of material with diameter 12 ft in the inflated shape. You can't just deform it however you like, it won't lie flat while deflated so calculating the area of a circle is not helpful.

Here's the right math:

If you take a sphere of unknown radius R, and you pull on either end of it, it will start to elongate into a sort of straightened banana. The length you will reach is a half-circle of radius R, and we are assuming this is 12'. A full circle has circumference 2_R, so a half circle has length _R. Which gives us the equation:

    _R = 12'
    R = 12' / _ ~= 3.82'

It's £2 for 24 hours of unlimited journeys as long as each journey is under 30 mins.  If you go over 30 mins with any one journey you will be charged £2.  Over 60 mins is another £2 and so on.

But if it's your first time in London, have you considered taking your time and going around the city to see the sights at your own pace? You won't see much of London outside London.

Try taking the Piccadilly line to Hyde Park Corner. Then hire one of the Santander Cycles public hire bikes from the red stands - you can do this with an app on your phone, you just need a credit card. It costs £2 for a day's access, and £2 for every 30 minutes you have a bike out at a time (the first 30 minutes is free.)

You can then go east and west along our brand new Cycle Superhighway. It goes through Hyde Park, past Buckingham Palace (this little bit isn't quite finished yet, but it's not too bad), and then past Big Ben, the London Eye, the Shard, and the Tower of London. If you keep going east it'll take you towards the East End and the big towers of Canary Wharf.

You can also try exploring the canals and parks. These can be quite narrow and busy with pedestrians, but it should be OK during autumn and winter - just ride slowly and use your bell, and you'll be fine. I recommend the Regent's Canal towpath, Victoria Park, and the new Olympic Park in Stratford. All of these are inside the cycle hire area. Victoria Park is especially beautiful.

It needn't be as exaggerated as that.  The problem is that you're competing with cars that do have lights.  If you're following a car in the dark with no lights, even on a reasonably lit street you can be completely invisible until you happen to drift between the tail lights and my eyes.

On the one hand, I think that 18 months for manslaughter is not enough - be it with a motorised vehicle, a push bike as was the case here or for example due to shoddy construction, a particularly unfortunate punch to the head in an alcohol fueled confrontation.

On the other hand, it's going to ruin his life for a couple of years - firstly wasted time in jail, then the difficulty of getting a job until he no longer has to declare the conviction when applying.

Personally I think jail time is warranted in this instance; he didn't have a brake; the bicycle therefore wasn't road-legal.  I also think he gives cycling a bad name when it's working hard to overcome its stigma and get more motorists to appreciate the needs of cyclists particularly in our busy cities.

On a side note away from the conviction though, there are many other cyclists that do cycling no favours.  There are plenty of them on the CS2 who ignore traffic lights completely (I note the Met had a day out about half a year ago where they ticketed dozens of them).  I have no doubt the same applies on all other CS routes in London.  Others wear no high visibility gear.  Still others either have pitiful £10 lights from Halfords (so useless they arguably should be banned from sale) or else simply don't bother at all.  You might be able to see well without lights going past Waterloo on a bicycle, bit different when you're a highly distracted motorist in the wet and dark negotiating randomly moving traffic and lots of lane turns and traffic lights.  

Both sides of the argument need to help each other and much more work needs to be done to bring them further into harmony.  Maybe closing down some of the smaller cross-city roads entirely into bicycle only routes might help to ease the problem but it certainly won't solve what is a complex argument -

It's useful information for people to realise that IMEI blocks, 'find my phone' and so on aren't going to protect them, and conversely that bike chains, covers, alarms and airlock doors really do reduce your chances of getting hit.  We place a lot of store in assuming that it just won't happen when we could, with minimal effort, make ourselves less vulnerable by thinking about it from the criminal's perspective.

There's an odd moment of almost paternal concern when the guy says, """"people are crossing the road staring at their phone - that's not normal"""".  He's a cunt but he's got a point - why are we not sufficiently motivated by the threat of being crushed by a car to pay attention while wandering around in front of them?  Frankly, if the threat of losing your phone motivates you more than the idea of being run over you have your priorities just as scrambled as someone who steals for a living.

Most of these guys are targeting low-hanging fruit, not mindlessly spreading violence and destruction and profiting on the side.  There was good defensive info in here for those willing to see past just feeling indignant about the criminality.

Taking steps to defend yourself isn't victim-blaming either.  Of course these guys *shouldn't* do what they do.  But we're definitely straying, as a society, over a line which makes it insufficiently hard for them to make a living as criminals and anything you can do to reduce your likelihood of being a victim is helpful.

You're right.  Write a letter of complaint to my old tutor immediately!

We all know that this research will be cited by people who haven't read the whole thing, and that it will be reported upon in the press missing details not obvious from a quick scan.  The article linked is unusual in that it picked up on this huge factor, and even then it was only mentioned in passing as an argument that the research was *more* reliable because it had no gender effect.  (I would have said, """"no inter-gender effect"""" but what do I know)  I'm just concerned that they didn't see fit to mention the word """"female"""" in the summary, and perceive a blasé attitude to potentially significant data which is dully familiar from reading the few hundred papers I came across back in the day.  It wasn't unusual to find overlapping trials from two different papers which gave opposite conclusions, or to see lines like, """"while not significant, this data implies.."""" which is the kind of horseshit that makes physicists snort with laughter.

I agree that this research is useful, and of course it contributes to our understanding beyond the specific constraints of the trials reported, but the way it's presented, and the way the linked article reported it, weren't quite as honest as I'd like.",,pineapplecharm,1,t1_dmoi8hi,dmoqy61,t3_6yeq2s,t5_2qhqb,1504797459,dmoi8hi,"I have to admit I'm a little surprised at this kind of talk from fellow a Psychology grad. The title could have mentioned it was a female only study, but that's just the title, they expect people to read if not the whole paper then at the very least, intro, results and discussion which should give ample insight as to their reasoning.

Again, as a psychology grad I'm astounded you've got to degree level and haven't learnt about applicability and generalisability. Of course the findings are narrow and only apply to women. But the researchers would never seek to claim otherwise. The results show how obedient women *can* be when placed in certain situations.

You also seem to have a dissonance between what you want to see. 

&gt;Doesn't that make the evidence very specific, at least until there's evidence otherwise?

&gt;This kind of shit is exactly why I didn't pursue psych any further than my degree; the whole field is awash with huge, potentially invalidating assumptions.  Factor in by far the most generous confidence intervals in modern science and you have, basically, evidence homeopathy.  Fucking psychology, man. 

Yes, this *one* study shows a particularly strict set of arguments about obedience in women. However when you combime that study with the huge number of other studies, conferences, papers, and theses on the topic of obedience (not all of which will be classic experiments, there are a large number of natural experiments and observational studies on the topic). You are able to develop at least an informed opinion on how people generally will operate when responding to situations where obedience is required/desired.

6069,"Ah, Mercator strikes again.

If you draw a straight line through Norway and double it in the same direction you get to northern Morocco, that is true.  But only on a Mercator map, which exaggerates distances closer to the poles.  Using the tool I linked above, you'll find that the true distance, in miles across the globe's surface, doesn't get that far south.

I mean, don't get me wrong, it's still pretty damn surprising.  If you mirror image Norway about Mandal, the southernmost town, you get roughly halfway down Italy.  Skarsvåg, Norway and Porto San Giorgio, Italy are both around 1055 miles from Mandal.  That's a straight north/south reflection as per the 'stand it up on the southern point and let it drop' wording suggests.  Continuing west as far as Norway stretches east as suggested by the Morocco answer gives you a place called Castex near Toulouse in France.

1050 miles due south of Mandal is in the med, which is probably the part my half-scrambled brain remembered.

To illustrated, [all three distances in this image are 1050-1055 miles](https://i.imgur.com/KMd7JXU.png) as the crow flies.  As you can see, Africa is still some way off.

Note, not """"had caused grief to even a single person who actually has lost a family member"""".  It sounds a lot more like it was from people who simply don't want to hear about sad things when they could be thinking about lovely burgers.

At very least, to be fair, it's kind of up to real people to decide if it causes distress.  Making up a straw offendee, as it were, is not helpful.

It's the same as the Maltesers ad:

Personally, if you're not disabled yourself I don't give a fuck *what* your opinion is of that ad.  I think it's great that a physically disabled person gets to tell a raunchy story for once, but it wouldn't matter if I didn't because, well, *I'm not disabled*.  It isn't offensive just because it's outside the experience of some meddlesome ratbag Daily Mail reader, and I rather suspect my reaction is exactly the one Maltesers wanted.

I think it's innocent.

1) The segment starts around 8.37 a.m. and the presenter explains  later on that Sugar has joined late- so I assume it's a tech issue or the others going on too long.

2) The subject of the segment is productivity, and Sugar gets a fair chance to talk about that.

3) I do think he also gets the chance to say what he thinks about the Brexit negotiations- that the wrong people are negotiating for us. But the main point is that it was NOT a Brexit segment anyway.
