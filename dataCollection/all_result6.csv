See, people; this is what happens when you try and show off your classical education - everyone gets confused.  If you're writing in English the plural should really be """"millenniums"""".  Who singles out just the plural for parent language grammar?  What about the vocative or ablative?  When was the last time you saw someone write, """"this is the longest standing tradition of the millennii"""" or """"I wish I could send eighties fashion back to the last millennio""""?

The town elders got together and did the smart thing, paid the army off to go sack somebody else.  It worked.

Also, part of the hornblower's job is to find the mayor and tell him the watch is set.  I've several times seen the hornblower come to various pubs to find the guy, and heard a local legend that hornblowers in the past have located the mayor at ... not his own house.  But a job's a job, so they made their announcement outside and left.

On top of the obelisk (which is pretty tall) is a golden horn, not unlike the one the hornblower blows.  Legend has it that there're gold coins inside, and every so often somebody tries to climb up to get them.  There's noting in there - they take the horn down every couple of decades for a cleaning, if there were coins they're long gone.

Have a [read of this by the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2014/feb/20/air-pollution-cyclists-bike-blog).

The difference you will see between cyclists and pedestrians is the fact that cyclists are moving around and as such are more likely to be moving out of polution and into 'fresh' air. As such don't get the same pollution levels as kerbside.

    const YEARS_PER_CENTURY = 100;

    const HOURS_PER_DAY = 24;
    const MINUTES_PER_HOUR = 60;
    const SECONDS_PER_MINUTE = 60;

Months per quarter?  Give me a break.  Look, all code is on a sliding scale from unintelligibly concise to confusingly verbose.  For me, this is too far towards the latter.  Constants are defined so that you can adjust them centrally, right?  But until we all lose our minds and decide to decimalise time the number of milliseconds in a minute isn't going to change, like, ever.  The only other reason would be clarity of code, which is easily achieved with comments, or indeed variable names.  Who the fuck wants to see:

    $msinyr = MILLISECONDS_IN_A_SECOND * SECONDS_IN_A_MINUTE * MINUTES_IN_AN_HOUR * HOURS_IN_A_DAY * DAYS_IN_A_WEEK * WEEKS_IN_A_YEAR;

when you can just put

    $milliseconds_in_a_year = 31557600000;

or

    $timeout = microtime() + 31557600000; // a year from now

If the number of days is going to change then of course that should be factored out *but not as a constant*.  If you're editing source code as part of your normal operations, you're doing it wrong.

Now, this also brings up another problem which is that multiplying all those constants together in my example will give you the wrong answer because there aren't precisely 52 weeks in a year.  So by defining all these constants you're actually just laying a big, fat trap for some poor sap to walk into when his mind is on other things.  By actually typing in the calculation you will go """"60 x 60 x 24 x oh wait should I put 365 or 365.25"""" which engages your brain with the problem rather than concentrating on not mis-spelling your verbose constant names.

Okay, some people might not know there are 365 days in a year.  Or 91 days might not be obviously 13 weeks at a glance, and I've often put something like:

    $days = 9*7; // nine weeks

but if you can't do the mental maths to convert *years* to *decades* without having it spelled out to you, you're in the wrong job.  We have decimalisation *precisely because* multiples of ten are bleedin' obvious.  Be honest - a sixteen character constant name is no substitute for a single zero.

1. Ensure everybody is safe and contact control
2. Light Up a fag and clock off as your hours are up.
3. Start a punch up with some of the more mouthy commuters
4. Continue as normal assuming it will be OK so as not to delay the train

Go back in no record of my answer and apparently I've failed as I don't meet the minimum requirement, it then gives a list of your answers, although of course it doesn't because the software has crashed and so it didn't record anything and so there is no way they could have worked out whether I met them or not.

I agree with everything you're saying, except this. Men don't need women to tell them how to be men. 

Feminism has always been about equal rights and opportunities...for women.

I think that men don__ identify as feminist because a lot of narrative, especially online, rides on the trope that men are uncontrolable beasts. Though there are of course many more feminist viewpoints out there, this one especially makes for good click baits and gets shared at lot. 

Of course most guys are gonna be offended by that, as most guys don__ recognize this experience. Especially in younger generation men  have been raised with explicite and implicite femimist values, and a lot of the work done by previous generations of feminist have become part of our culture at large. Values such as equal oppertunity, girls can do anything boys can etc have become pretty normal. In other words, great strides have been made in our undrstanding of what a woman is and can be.

The other way around not so much. It__ much less accepted for boys to be into ballet, or wearing a dress, or to consider traditionally female jobs, such as daycare (this one especially is of limits for men because they are __ncontrollable beasts and will molest your child_, or so the narrative goes).  I think we need more work done on understanding what it means to be a man, and that feminism needs to let men in on the conversation instead of pushing them away with terms as mansplaining.

And some other areas like law, tenured professors, and so on.)

So what? Women receive much, much lighter sentences for the same crime than men. 

Which brings me to a general point. Feminism is constantly arguing under a false premise, namely to assume that men in power use that power to help men exclusively. It's simply false. Men do **not** feel particular allegiance towards other men based on gender. It's pretty much a projection from women's/feminist's side, considering that women have a much stronger in-group bias. They know women in power are more likely to focus on women's desires and thus assume men to be the same. On the contrary, men adore women and often go out of their way to help and please women, often throwing fellow men under the bus in the process. Funnily enough, this lack of inherent solidarity amongst men is one reason why the MRM has a much more difficult standing than feminism. 

Feminists need to explain this: If men in power were such horrible sexists, feminism would not have happened. Instead, it's literally the most succesful social revolutionary movement in history, installing itself as a major political power within a short amount of time. And while other revolutionaries often paid in blood (lots of blood), feminists barely bled and died for their cause. It was an incredibly smooth ride compared to Europe's worker's rights movement of the late 19th century or the various national independency movements (India, North Africa etc.) of the mid 20th century. The immense success of feminism directly contradicts feminist conspiracy theories of powerful male cabals who consciously and exclusively oppress women.

Ok, so the US government and top executives in private sector are overwhelmingly male. But who put those men there?

[Women control 60% of all wealth in the US and account for 80% of all consumer spending](http://shurwest.com/2017/03/14/financial-facts-womens-history-month/) even though they earn less in the aggregate. Whose money are they spending?

Well, it's either their higher-earning partners (men mostly), or it's the government. [Twice as many women as men have used food stamps.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/12/the-politics-and-demographics-of-food-stamp-recipients/) [Female-householder programs are the single greatest recipients of means-tested assistance programs.](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-97.html)  

(In fairness, there are some important fields of influence where men still dominate: [About 2/3 of all judges are male.](https://www.nawj.org/statistics/2016-us-state-court-women-judges) And some other areas like law, tenured professors, and so on.)

I'm not even going to bring up all the other stats to show the many ways men have it worse than women (shorter life spans, far higher incarceration rates, higher suicide rates, higher alcoholism and drug addition rate, far more likely to be victims of violent crime, etc). I'm not going to talk about whether it's fair or not how much easier it is for a woman to get laid than it is for a man (why do you think prostitution is the world's oldest profession?) I'm not going to talk about how it's the women who rule households in almost every society on the planet (""""who wears the pants"""" is an ironic question). I'm not going to talk about how girls and young women are surrounded by media messaging constantly telling them how great they are (acknowledging there are also impossible beauty standards imposed on them) while at the same time telling boys they're all potential rapists or losers.

Hovering is staying overtop of a fixed point. If that fixed point is moving away from you (or you from it) you are not hovering. You also would have a velocity relative to the earth, or landspeed.

If the earth were in a vacuum, and somehow the helicopter still worked, you still would be going in the direction that you left the earth in, as you'd still have that momentum swinging you around in the same direction.

Now what IS kind of cool is the Coriolis Effect. This is kind of what you are asking about, but actually happens. This is the best write up I can find thats easy to understand. This happens to sniper bullets over long distances, and long distance aircraft as they fly across the earth. Basically if you start at the equator and fly straight towards the north pole, and donot steer, you end up going east, or left, on the globe. To fly """"straight north"""" you actually would have to fly towards the west to compensate.

1. Because Republicans control both houses they don't want to be continually labeled as the do nothing party that doesn't get anything realistically done (they arguably have this persona right now after four years of complete symbolic and """"impassable"""" legislation). To combat this and to prove they are better than Democrats at running the government, they will actually be willing to work with the other side and make compromises. If they want to show how well a Republican government runs they will have to actually work with Democrats.

2. The same thing the last four years have given us: gridlock. If they are unwilling to work with Democrats or vehemently push the idea that the midterms gave them a mandate then nothing's going to happen. This can happen for many reasons: if the republicans can't control their tea party radicals and get them to actually compromise on good sense legislation, they cannot work with Obama due to creating such a large amount of hate for him, the Democrats want to filibuster most things even if republicans offer productive compromises (unlikely as Democrats have no incentive to seem like the intransigent ones at the moment and hurt 2016 prospects), or they are just unwilling to write legislation that can pass.

I recently became the foreman at my job, as the previous one left, and I was next in line. About a week into my new commission, four members of my crew suddenly started calling out to deal with some serious personal shit. 

Let's call these four E (male, spoiler, is ultimately the villain in this story, kind of looks like Christian Bale. Really loves the movie Pain and Gain), A (female, dated E after meeting him via work. Broke up with him a few months ago, went off for the summer, came back, and sort of started to rekindle things with E.), B (male, E's cousin, got E the job. Really big ogre of a man, looks nothing like E.), and J (B's best friend, also went to college with A and me.).

So, I start getting tidbits of info about what's going on, why I'm losing workers at crucial times, but nothing concrete. Something is going on with E. Probably in regards to A. I still can't imagine what could be so important as to miss so much work. 

Fast forward a bit B and A come back to work, happy and cheery. J isn't in that day, because he has rehearsal for a show he's in. I know A's been dealing with some shit, so I give her a hug, even though I don't know the problem. She accepts the hug, even holds it a bit long - I can tell she needed that hug. She gets to work, is laughing, joking around like always. 

About midday, I realize I haven't seen A or B for a bit. I don't pay too much attention. I call a 10 for everyone, because I want a cigarette. B comes back and lights up, not saying anything. A comes back sobbing, gathering her stuff, says someone broke into her house, she has to go. She speeds off. 

B makes a phone call to (I later found out) E's mom, who lives 3-4 hours away. I here things like """"E is with you right? What do you mean no? I TOLD YOU TO KEEP HIM UP THERE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DONE???"""" 

Since this shit started, I recently got the whole story, so now let's pause, rewind a bit, and fill in the fact gaps... 

E tried to kill himself one night. A decided they shouldn't get back together, because of work and everything, and E couldn't take that answer, swallowed a bunch of pills. A rushed to his house, made him puke, and called 911. For the next few weeks, B, A, and J were rotating calling out so that one of them could be with E at all times. E got violent a few times. His emotions became erratic. He loved them for being there for him, and he hated them for holding him down, restraining him. He used coercion and even physical force to get A to sleep with him, though he backed off on the latter. 

One night, B was able to get E's family to drive down and pick him up, take him back home. They had to physically shove him into the car. He broke the antenna off A's car in the struggle. B tells the family, """"He's sick, he needs help. Keep him up there, don't let him come back here."""" Then we don't here from E for 3 days. 

Flash back to present scenario, the cops caught the guy who broke into A's house. Surprise, surprise it's E. 

A lives with her mom, and has cameras around the house. She knows more or less what's been going on, and on a bad feeling hunch, she checks the cameras' live feed from work. Three of them are dark. She sees a figure, covering his face with a sheet, throw the sheet onto the camera. This guy knows where all the cameras are. She calls the cops, then calls A. By the time A gets there, they have E in custody. She goes into her bedroom. Her cat is on her bed. It's not sleeping, it's dead. It wasn't bludgeoned, it was strangled. E has cat claw marks on his arm. 

E is now in a high security psych prison with no bail, no contact with anyone but his lawyer and the doctor. A hasn't been back to work yet. B and J are working, but are noticeably different. 

These aren't just my employees, they're my friends. Well, I was friends with who I *thought* E was, but not the person behind the mask.

6471,"Middle East[edit]
In 1952, when Egypt had been taken over by General Mohammed Naguib, Skorzeny was sent to Egypt the following year by former General Reinhard Gehlen (who was now working for the CIA) to act as Naguib's military advisor. Skorzeny recruited a staff made up of former SS and Wehrmacht officers to train the Egyptian army. Among these officers were SS General Wilhelm Farmbacher, Panzer General Oskar Munzel, Leopold Gleim, head of the Gestapo Department for Jewish Affairs in Poland, and Joachim Daemling, former chief of the Gestapo in DÃ¼sseldorf. In addition to training the army, Skorzeny also trained Arab volunteers in commando tactics for possible use against British troops stationed in the Suez Canal zone. Several Palestinian refugees also received commando training, and Skorzeny planned their raids into Israel via the Gaza Strip in 1953-1954. One of these Palestinians was Yasser Arafat.[27] He would eventually serve as an adviser to Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.[28]

Skorzeny later provided intelligence to the Mossad about ex-Nazi scientists working for the Egyptian government. Skorzeny agreed to cooperate with Israel on the condition that Simon Wiesenthal erase his name from the list of wanted Nazi war criminals and act to have an arrest warrant against him cancelled. Though Wiesenthal rejected this request, Skorzeny decided in the end to cooperate with the Mossad anyway.[29][30]",,sosorrynoname,2,t1_cx3v8q7,cx3wv6e,t3_3t64ld,t5_2s7yq,1447804106,cx3v8q7,"And Wernher von Braun noted Nazi and member of the SS helped America's rocket program no end with the help with a few other Nazis.

I would like to offer the mindframe and standpoint of President Obama, who is currently fighting for the refugees to an overwhelmingly opposing American public, as well as my own point of view. Please read fully before downvoting, I am simply trying to speak for people whom few seem to be speaking for.

__rejudice and discrimination helps ISIL and undermines our national security,_ Obama said.
""""Refugees who end up in the United States are the most... thuroughly investigated individuals that ever arrived on american shores.""""
After visiting a classroom of Syrian refugees, Obama said """"If you were a parent and you saw those kids, and you thought about what they had gone through? The notion that we [the American public] could not find a home, for them, anywhere in the United States of America? ...That is contrary to our values.""""

The majority of refugees ARE women and children. Opposers such as Trump seem to be ignoring this fact. You are promoting the notion to deny entire families the basic rights we have here that they want so desperately. 

Furthermore, denying the refugees the opportunity to enter the United States and other first world countries alike promotes the mixed feelings some of these people may have, and may push them to become terrorists themselves. This is what obama is referring to when he speaks of ISIS's """"promotion of fear"""" in the American (and the world's) people. Fear keeps us from helping these people because of things they hypothetically could do. Intolerance and fear in first world countries has a direct correlation to promoting hatred twoards us in the people that we are denying entry.

Reality is that the majority of these refugees are simply trying to escape the hell they used to call home. By sending them back, we are sending them back to the people they are running away from (and who knows what torturous methods these radicals would dream up for deserters), back to the possibility of being bombed by us, and promoting hatred, possibly pushing some of them to join ISIS. We are effectively doing nothing in the long term but creating more enemies for ourselves, and killing these people by collateral by bombings. At the very least, we are sending them back to the hell holes they called home.

Think about what these people are going through over there right now. Sure, we could send them away for the temporary satisfaction that we prevented a miniscule fraction of the refugees who are potential terrorists. But in the long run if we let them in, we would be saving many lives and limiting the world enemies we have. In your heart I know you know we cannot turn down tens of thousands of innocent people because we are scared of what very, very few of them could hypothetically do. We must be strong, and help out those who call on our capable helping hands, because they need our help. Simple as that.

It is wrong that we turn these people away, that is what it boils down to. It goes against the morals we all stand for. Religious freedom, justice for all. The right to vote, express concerns, individuality. Please, spread the word. We need to change the mind of the American people and any others who oppose helping Syrian refugees. It is WRONG to turn innocent people away in their hour of need, and doing so because we are scared of what some of them could do will only hurt both parties in the long run.

The solution is simple, do not register to vote.

Most poor people do not register to vote, at least most of the people I know, specifically for this reason.

I made the mistake of registering:

As a minimum wage worker that was called for jury duty and desperately pleaded to not serve due to financial hardship, as in I would literally lose my house, I was rescheduled for the end of the year and luckily was never called. Had I been I would have lost everything.

And believe you me, no lawyer would stand up for me when I would inevitably get fired (being fired would not be the cause of losing my house, not earning money for a week would be the cause, the firing would inevitably follow).

After telling my friends and family they told me the mistake I made.

Their namings were separate occurrences, with Iceland colonised many generations before Greenland.  Greenland's name was of course a tad optimistic *if applied to the entire island generally*, but this was a natural consequence of the desire to draw colonists (from among the Norse themselves) to a new colony.  And the motivation to explore and colonise was strong, particular in Erik the Red, who was instrumental to Greenland's colonisation.  
  
While Greenland was not so green as its name suggested, the promotional description is in keeping with, for example, the less than credibly idyllic description given to [Vinland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinland) likewise, in the sagas.  One does not brag of having discovered a glacial waste.  One brags of having discovered a glorious new land.  
  
But perhaps most importantly, the part of Greenland colonised by the Norse was *not* a glacial waste, during the [Medieval Warm Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period).  Indeed, it was *green*.  So the description was not a deception, as far as that goes.  Agriculture was possible then, though it is not now.

Since he only cited another blogger for his source (what's up with all the blog sources in columns these days?), I figured I would look him up to see why I should take him as a scientific source on such an important issue. It turns out that this man has no scientific schooling, and has argued the following against broad scientific consensus:

* There is no link between passive smoking and cancer.
* Intelligent design is a superior alternative to current evolutionary theory.
* White asbestos exposure does not present a risk of mesothelioma (this was called out as dangerously wrong and was even countered by the head of the group that conducted the study he """"sourced"""" from).

I encourage anyone willing to take the words of just two men to read up on the controversies surrounding their opinion and methodologies - Wikipedia articles for [Christopher Booker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Booker) and [Steven Goddard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Goddard) will give you somewhere to start. We are talking about an extremely important and pressing issue, regardless of which side you are on. Hopefully if you are making up your mind you are trained in the field or using credible news sources who are citing peer-reviewed scientific studies as a basis for their news article. Anyone can start up a blog and put their opinion out there based off of a set of data points. However, that should not be expected to be taken as a scientific standard or that presidential candidates should base their views on climate science off of them.

&gt; We also asked experts in the use of human tissue for research about the potential for profit. Sherilyn J. Sawyer, the director of Harvard University and Brigham and Women__ Hospital__ __iorepository,_ told us that __here__ no way there__ a profit at that price._ She continued in an email:
&gt; Sawyer, July 20: In reality, $30-100 probably constitutes a loss for [Planned Parenthood]. The costs associated with collection, processing, storage, and inventory and records management for specimens are very high. Most hospitals will provide tissue blocks from surgical procedures (ones no longer needed for clinical purposes, and without identity) for research, and cost recover for their time and effort in the range of $100-500 per case/block. In the realm of tissues for research $30-100 is completely reasonable and normal fee.
&gt; 
&gt; Jim Vaught, president of the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories and formerly the deputy director of the National Cancer Institute__ Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research, told us in an email that _$30 to $100 per sample is a reasonable charge for clinical operations to recover their costs for providing tissue._ In fact, he said, the costs to a clinic are often much higher, but most operations that provide this kind of tissue have __o intention of fully recovering [their] costs, much less making a profit._
&gt; Carolyn Compton, the chief medical and science officer of Arizona State University__ National Biomarkers Development Alliance and a former director of biorepositories and biospecimen research at the National Cancer Institute, agreed that this was __ modest price tag for cost recovery._ Compton told us in an email: _ __rofit_ is out of the question, in my mind. I would say that whoever opined about __rofit_ knows very little about the effort and expense involved in providing human biospecimens for research purposes._


&gt; What Does the Law Say?
&gt; 
&gt; In a statement made to CNN, another presidential candidate, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, called the practice discussed in the video a __lear violation of federal law._ The __ale_ of organs, both adult and fetal, for transplantation is indeed illegal, but donation of tissue _ both from aborted fetuses and from adults _ is not. And payment for __easonable_ costs is also allowed under the law.
&gt; The video itself highlights a portion of title 42 of the U.S. code, which reads: __t shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce._ The law does include fetal tissue in its definitions. It says that the term __aluable consideration_ doesn__ include __easonable payments_ for removal, transportation, preservation and other associated costs.
&gt; In 1993, a law pertaining to federally funded NIH research was enacted that allows donation of fetal tissue from induced abortions if certain criteria are met. These include that the woman donating is not aware of the recipients of the tissue, and that the abortion timing, procedures or method itself would not be altered for the sole purpose of obtaining the tissue.
&gt; The 1993 law also says that it is unlawful __or any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce._ The law again excludes the types of costs Nucatola discussed in the video: __he term __aluable consideration_ does not include reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue._
&gt; The American Medical Association echoes this in its ethical guidelines on the issue: __etal tissue is not provided in exchange for financial remuneration above that which is necessary to cover reasonable expenses._

""""...But why, exactly, is that phrase so problematic? On Reddit, user GeekAesthete broke it down with a perfect analogy:

""""Imagine that you're sitting down to dinner with your family, and while everyone else gets a serving of the meal, you don't get any. So you say, """"I should get my fair share."""" And as a direct response to this, your dad corrects you, saying, """"Everyone should get their fair share."""" Now, that's a wonderful sentiment _ Indeed, everyone should, and that was kinda your point in the first place: that you should be a part of everyone, and you should get your fair share also. However, dad's smart-ass comment just dismissed you and didn't solve the problem that you still haven't gotten any!

""""The problem is that the statement """"I should get my fair share"""" had an implicit """"too"""" at the end: """"I should get my fair share, too, just like everyone else."""" But your dad's response treated your statement as though you meant """"only I should get my fair share,"""" which clearly was not your intention. As a result, his statement that """"everyone should get their fair share,"""" while true, only served to ignore the problem you were trying to point out.

""""Just like asking dad for your fair share, the phrase """"black lives matter"""" also has an implicit """"too"""" at the end: It's saying that black lives should also matter. But responding to this by saying """"all lives matter"""" is willfully going back to ignoring the problem. It's a way of dismissing the statement by falsely suggesting that it means """"only black lives matter,"""" when that is obviously not the case. And so saying """"all lives matter"""" as a direct response to """"black lives matter"""" is essentially saying that we should just go back to ignoring the problem.""""

* Low-income areas have less access to fresh grocers

* When available, healthy foods - especially produce - are of a lesser quality in low income area grocers

* Higher quality food is more expensive; consequently lower-quality food is cheaper.

* Low-income areas have a higher concentration of fast food restaurants

* Low-income families and houses have less access to exercise facilities and resources such as payed gyms, sports programs, and open areas such as parks, or when available such spaces are not attractive(ie run-down, dirty, unsafe)

* They have less access to affordable health-care(perhaps less so now with Obamacare though)

* If food is scarce, a person is more likely to overeat when food does become available, in a """"feast or famine"""" mentality in preparation for another possible fast.

**2.)** We understand if you get lost while driving.  Please pull over while you figure stuff out, or if you just need to slow down, get into the right lane.


**3.**) Use crosswalks.  Don't cross against the lights, even though the college students do it.  They get run over a lot anyway, so they're not setting a great example.


**4.)** Don't call the city 'Beantown.'  That's ridiculous.


**5.)** Upon finding out that you are talking to a local, it's fine to ask for advice for things to do (I love suggesting this stuff!).  But don't roll your eyes when we suggest something that's actually interesting and not touristy, and then buy tickets to the Swan Boats.


**6.)**  Don't make fun of the accents.  Don't ask me why I don't have an accent.  I don't know.  Some of us just don't.


**7.)**  Don't be afraid to use the subway to get around.  Most of the best places are best accessed that way.

**8.)** Don't stop in the middle of our narrow sidewalks.  Most of us are trying to get to and from work.


**9.)** *Most importantly.* don't judge us by our cool and reserved Yankee aloofness.  There are a lot of us, myself included, that **LOVE** our city, take pride in it, and will jump at the chance to offer help or tips to a visiting tourist.  Just be friendly and polite, and you'll be surprised at how many of us will welcome you with open arms.  You'll be amazed at how far a little common sense and courtesy go, here.

6903,"The Daily Mail recently reported that the University of Edinburgh found __or onshore wind, the monthly __oad factor_ of turbines _ a measure of how much electricity they generate as a percentage of how much they could produce if on at full power all the time - dropped from a high of 24 per cent in the first year after construction, to just 11 per cent after 15 years._

That__ a 55 percent drop, for you dinosaurs who still think that is important _ and that is just for turbines still working.

There__ a reason why so many wind projects got so much attention on the drawing board, but when it comes time to build them, they wither away. The offshore wind project in Delaware is a good example: One day it was hailed as the secret to the universe. The next day, it was gone. It disappeared down a black hole when people who actually had to pay for it and build it figured out what it actually was going to cost them.

It was the real numbers that scared them off. In America, these numbers are harder to come by _ another red flag for investors _ but as many as 1 in 4 wind turbines just does not work. Some do not even spin. Others spin, but do not generate electricity, so it is hard to tell by looking at them.

Hawaii provides the favorite example: The 37 turbines at the Kamaoa Wind Farm stood derelict for more than six years after it was discovered that repairs were more expensive than replacements. This is just one of six abandoned wind farms in one of the most wind-ideal places on the planet.

The Altamont Pass Wind Farm in Northern California used to be the largest wind farm on Earth. Now it is best known as the largest killer of eagles and other raptors. The turbines are shut down for four months a year to protect the birds during their migration. So much for that pro-forma. 

As many as 4,500 wind turbines have been built _ and abandoned _ in California alone. 

How long can that last? Ask that question of a True Believer at your own peril. They say  making money is no longer the point of being in business; saving the planet is.

Even Al Gore is getting out of alternative energy such as wind. Just check the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings for his company, Generation Investment. Not a wind play in the portfolio. 

There may be one million reasons to invest in wind, or to install a windmill. Most involve bragging to your friends that you are saving the planet. But if you need the energy or the money, don__ _ because right now, wind is still nothing more than a faith-based initiative.

Just ask Al. ",,sosorrynoname,-7,t1_cy13sj9,cy15ldy,t3_3x2fpo,t5_2qh13,1450285044,cy13sj9,"They aren't obselete.

Wittman's memoir](http://www.amazon.com/Priceless-Undercover-Rescue-Worlds-Treasures/dp/0307461483/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450362021&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=priceless+how+i+went+undercover+to+rescue+the+world%27s+stolen+treasures) and [journalistic research into famous modern art heists](http://www.amazon.com/The-Rescue-Artist-Thieves-Masterpiece/dp/0060531185/ref=pd_sim_14_6?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=51mhWJa1ggL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR106%2C160_&amp;refRID=0Z4NEV65DX4FERWG8V4E), the answer is probably not, at least as far as art crime goes. While there appears to be evidence that there are criminal gangs who specialize in dealing with stolen art, it's extremely unlikely that their operations are being bankrolled by a secretive, wealthy benefactor who hides away his stolen treasures for private use. There is one book called [Stolen Masterpiece Tracker](http://www.amazon.com/Stolen-Masterpiece-Tracker-Thomas-McShane/dp/1569803145/ref=pd_sim_14_96?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=41xbC61nLzL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR105%2C160_&amp;refRID=0Z4NEV65DX4FERWG8V4E) by a retired FBI agent named Thomas McShane which claims that almost every art theft ever is absolutely ordered by some rich person who hires a team of criminals, however he offers absolutely no evidence to support this and quite frankly the rest of the book makes him sound like a bit of a loony old man so I can't say I trust what he says (not a terrible read if you're really interested in the topic though).





The boring truth is that, as far as we can tell, most art is stolen as a type of black market collateral or bearer bond. Valuable paintings and other artworks are often bartered for drugs, held as collateral on loans between groups, and sometimes used like retirement funds for career criminals. I can't recall which exact painting it was, but a few years ago I was reading a news article, and one of the works listed in [Museum of the Missing](http://www.amazon.com/Museum-Missing-History-Art-Theft/dp/1402728298/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450362847&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=museum+of+the+missing+a+history+of+art+theft) was found practically by accident when police raided an apartment looking for a suitcase of drugs, only to find that the case had already been exchanged for the stolen painting. 




The laws in various countries for the statute of limitations and ownership also make using pieces as long term investments reasonably practical. If a thief can steal a painting and successfully hide it from law enforcement for the period outlined by the law, they can legally claim themselves as the rightful owners of that piece, even if they were convicted and served time for its theft. This often ends up being a few decades but nonetheless, for someone who has no legal money to invest it's a tempting prospect, especially when the punishments for such crimes are relatively lenient.




Other times it's the thieves themselves who want to keep the artwork for their personal collections. A recent example is [a French man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Breitwieser) (sorry for the wiki link but I can't remember which books he was listed in) who simply liked the art so much that he wanted it for himself. There was a similar case investigated by the FBI of a man in New York a few years back who liked to use his stolen art to help him seduce the young men he brought home.




tl;dr As far as art crime goes, there are several motives for thefts, but as far as we can tell none of them involve a greedy billionaire hiring a gang to provide him with his own secret room of treasures. It's certainly possible that statistically there are one or two people like that in the world, but even if this were the case it would only account for a very tiny percentage of art thefts. In reality it's mostly just regular people being greedy.


If you're interested in learning about art crime I highly suggest starting with [The Rescue Artist](http://www.amazon.com/The-Rescue-Artist-Thieves-Masterpiece/dp/0060531185/ref=pd_sim_14_9?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=51mhWJa1ggL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR106%2C160_&amp;refRID=16N6CPE80QS1W2Q67W2J) by Edward Dolnick. He's a good writer and is *very* thorough in his research.

There are plenty of other great books on thefts throughout the more modern era, such as [The Napoleon of Crime](http://www.amazon.com/Napoleon-Crime-Times-Worth-Master/dp/0307886468/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450364104&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+napoleon+of+crime) and [Flawless](http://www.amazon.com/Flawless-Inside-Largest-Diamond-History/dp/1402797559/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450364133&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=flawless+diamond) that aren't strictly art related but still good reads.

Theoretically? Time is a continuous quantity in both quantum and general relativity. There is no experimental evidence to suggest a minimum time interval. Some unconfirmed theoretical models suggest such a time interval, but some don't. 

Note that the Planck time is not regarded as a minimum time interval, rather it's a characteristic time interval on which quantum gravity is thought to operate at, lower than which our notion of time would change.

7068,3 percent of everyone on Earth is descended from Genghis Khan.,t1_cngr7t9,sosorrynoname,8,t1_cngpona,cngr7t9,t3_2rj6pl,t5_2qh1i,1420591417,cngpona,"Hopefully not too late but have to point out that if anyone here enjoys awesome historical facts you should definitely give [Dan Carlin's Hardcore History](http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/) podcast a go.  
  
Currently listening to his 4 part series about Genghis Khan...and it's amazing. He has a way with setting up imagery that stays with you.  
  
Currently, the one I'm thinking of is when a Muslim King sends a spy mission to China in order to see whether or not it's a place he can conquer. He doesn't know much about the place beyond some stories he's heard from passing merchants, so he sends a man named Baha' al-Din along with a few dozen men to check things out and report back.  
  
Well, as it turns out this is also the time when Genghis Khan is laying waste to China. So when al-Din gets to China it becomes quickly apparent to him that there is something very, very wrong with this place called China. As they travel the countryside, things start to pop up, such as when they thought they saw a snow capped mountain in the distance...only to realize that it was actually a giant pile of bones, so large that it had appeared to be a mountain from the distance. Or the fact that they eventually had to get off the road because the ground had turned into a greasy marsh because thousands upon thousands of bodies had decomposed on the road. The stench of the road was in fact so bad, that several member of the expedition actually got sick and died.  
  
Eventually they reached what is now modern day Beijing, a city of well over a million people called Zhongdu. Now at this time, this was one of the, if not THE largest city on earth. The Muslims had never seen a city  of this size, it was massive with immense walls, hundreds of towers, and gates, and parapets. To them it represented a country of gargantuan size and wealth..and they found it utterly decimated.  
  
So now al-Din had several things to report back to his king. He had to come back and explain that he'd found a kingdom of previously unheard levels of wealth and power...and that **something** had crushed them with terrifying thoroughness and brutality.  
   
--------------------------   
  
I do the story very little justice, so I very much recommend you check out the podcast. It also goes into some very interesting themes. Such as how a good deal of history is actually Revisionist History. With many historians retroactively attributing good things from the conquests of great and famount men...when in actuality, those good things such as the spread of cultures or the unification of people were actually unintended boons that came as a result of mass murder and conquest. The idea that time has robbed of the ability to see the cost of those great things we now enjoy.    
   
**TL;DR:** I am a poor wordsmith but Hardcore History is an awesome podcast about how hardcore history really is.

Fast forward to the 2000's and Dubya was pushing for every American to own their own home.   Sounded like an admirable goal.  Except the banks were giving out loans to people who they knew would never pay them back.  

Why would they do that, you ask?   Because they would then sell that debt to other companies.   Those companies, knowing full well it was bad debt, packaged a whole lot of those mortgages together and sold them as good investments.   The stock market was booming but it was based largely on these crappy mortgages. 

Also we now know that the federal reserve (which is supposed to regulate banks) was turning a blind eye to these activities.  So finally the banks went to the government and admitted what they had been doing and basically said if the government didn't bail them out the shit was really going to hit the fan. 

So,  all these people who had bought homes they couldn't afford got foreclosed on.   All these extra houses on the market caused everybody's home values to plummet.   The banks were forced to really tighten up their lending practices which coupled with the crashing stock market killed the construction industry for awhile.

* Coral reefs are experiencing more stress from frequent sea surface temperature anomalies and 30% increase in ocean acidity. They have to maintain a certain pH inside their tissue for metabolic processes to occur and yet they're competing with a changing pH of the ocean. Now there are more frequent bleaching events and disease outbreaks caused by this increase in stress. Other organisms such as krill are having a difficult time metabolizing their food in acidic waters. Krill in the arctic (where ocean acidification is greater) also have a slower metabolism in more acidic water. 
* Cyclones are formed from simple thunderstorms. However, these thunderstorms can only grow to cyclone strength with cooperation from both the ocean and the atmosphere. First of all, the ocean water itself must be warmer than **26.5 degrees Celsius (81Â°F)**. The heat and moisture from this warm water is ultimately the source of energy for cyclones. Sea *surface* temperature anomalies are becoming more common....which means the likelihood of cyclones occurring will increase.
* Some adult ocean organisms may fare fine in a more acidic world, but what about their eggs (lionfish can lay up to 2.5 million eggs a year and the majority of those eggs don't make it...so what about the few that do?) or the development of each organism or the protein and enzyme function necessary for metabolism, growth and reproduction? 80% (&gt;90,000 describes species) of all ocean organisms spend the beginning of their life as plankton and they all are part of an interconnected web (each step of their development may require different prey). Although aquaculture of marine life has proved to be a daunting task, we know that even the slightest chemical or temperature change can have a negative effect on developing larvae.",t1_cps4jzv,athomps121,2,t1_cprpakn,cps4jzv,t3_30ddfg,t5_2cneq,1427423284,0.187143,0.125156,0.146685,0.243504,0.331042,-0.530324,0.546961,0.565765,0.141328,0.059244,0.06637,-0.586781,0.053340722,0.04513533

The mufti spent the war years in Germany garnering Muslim support for Hitler's cause and creating friendly ties for the Nazi empire with Arab leaders. After the war, the Mufti fled Germany and was instrumental in helping fleeing Nazi's after World War II to find refuge in the Middle East.

The report, which was shared with several state and federal agencies on Monday, is unclassified but has not been released to the public or to media.

Boston police suspect many non-citizens arrested for trafficking heroin may have also committed identity fraud, suggesting those traffickers are in the U.S. illegally.

Boxborough police said that Eduardo Alementa Torres, 48, who is originally from Mexico, was driving a 1988 Chevrolet pickup truck with an expired inspection sticker when an officer saw him at about 10:45 a.m. on the southbound ramp from Massachusetts Avenue to Interstate 495 and pulled him over.

The officer saw an open beer bottle on the passenger seat and detected a strong odor of alcohol, police said. Torres failed a field sobriety test and submitted to a breath test, which showed that his blood alcohol level was .09 percent, according to police.

The legal limit to drive in Massachusetts is .08 percent.

Police said Torres had no identification on him and gave the officer a false name.

Torres was identified when police ran his fingerprints through an automated identification system, and police also learned that he had three prior drunken driving convictions in California and two in Massachusetts, authorities said.

Police said that Torres is a previously deported fugitive wanted by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

A suspected illegal immigrant from Mexico has been charged with drunk driving in a collision that killed another driver _ a 66-year-old former missionary returning to his Noblesville, Indiana, home after a long night at work.

Elizabeth Vargas-Hernandez, 35, was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated causing death, WRTV-TV reported, adding that she also was cited for operating a vehicle without ever receiving a driver__ license.

State police told WRTV that Vargas-Hernandez, of Indianapolis, is believed to be an undocumented Mexican national.

The suspect was traveling at a high rate of speed on Interstate 465 around 2:30 a.m. Monday when she slammed her SUV into David Kriehn__ car, which careened off the highway and rolled over several times into a ditch, police told WTHR-TV.

Everyone has a slightly different version of what happened on that late-summer evening in Milford in 2011, but the gruesome details are consistent.

Police say Nicolas Guaman, an undocumented immigrant from Ecuador, was driving drunk with his son in the car when, near the corner of Fayette and Congress, he hit and killed 23-year-old Matthew Denice, a recent college graduate who was riding his motorcycle home.

It was the kind of summer evening when folks were out barbecuing on the lawn, and there were plenty of witnesses.

It's unclear how many times Denice was struck, but it's clear Guaman never bothered to stop and check. He drove off from the scene.

Now, nearly three years after the accident, Guaman goes on trial Wednesday morning in Worcester Superior Court. He faces seven charges: murder, manslaughter by motor vehicle, motor vehicle homicide while under the influence of alcohol and negligent operation, reckless endangerment of a child, leaving the scene of an accident causing death, failure to stop for a police officer and unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle.

His lawyer has asked for a bench trial, meaning the verdict is in the hands of the judge. There will be no jury.

A Rallying Cry Against Immigrants 

The accident's aftershocks still reverberate in Milford, a small MetroWest town with a population just under 28,000. It's also overwhelmingly white, according to the latest census data. Slowly though, Latinos have been chipping away at that majority.

""""Anybody in this town is getting undercut by illegal aliens so bad it's hard to make a living anymore,"""" Jack Strapponi said at a tattoo parlor on the main strip in town, getting a blue flower fixed on his arm.

Most of the other businesses on the street are Latino restaurants, storefront churches or hair salons.

Strapponi says illegal immigrants are changing the flavor of the city. They wear their soccer cleats in the park and mess up the lawn.

""""I'm 53 years old and I lived in this town pretty much my whole entire life,"""" Strapponi explained. """"I'm Italian and my great grandparents were immigrants, but they came over here legally. They learned how to speak English.""""

Strapponi says the town started to change as soon as all the Ecuadorians moved in _ though it's not clear when that shift began and how many Ecuadorians call Milford home these days.

""""I know that sounds racist, but it's not,"""" Strapponi said. """"It's like they just took up all the jobs.""""

He says the accident that killed Matthew Denice struck a raw nerve.

""""There's been such an influx of illegal aliens in this town, you know, people are finally just fed up,"""" he said.

But there also seems to be a generational difference. Around town, younger folks who went to high school with Denice seem to adopt a more nuanced attitude.

Kane Rogers is the tattoo artist who was working on Strapponi's arm.

""""If that guy hit him, and hit him on the bike, it's one thing that he had no license and was driving drunk, that was the main thing,"""" Rogers said. """"The fact that he came from somewhere, it sucks that that has to be grouped in.""""

Rogers says he doesn't understand why the hit-and-run has become a rallying cry against immigrants. These days, it's such a part of the town folklore that even new immigrants, like Lorana Hernandez, who moved to Milford last year, know all about the accident.

n the five years since an unlicensed illegal immigrant ran down his son, Don Rosenberg has turned his anger and grief into a mission to answer a seemingly simple question: How many people are killed each year by drivers who don__ belong in the U.S., much less behind a wheel?

Drew Rosenberg, a 25-year-old student at Golden Gate University, was riding his motorcycle in San Francisco when Roberto Galo struck him on Nov. 16, 2010. In his frenzied effort to flee the scene, Galo ran over his victim twice. The elder Rosenberg got the news no parent should hear from San Francisco General Hospital that night, but what he would learn over the next few years only compounded his bitterness.

As many as 7,500 Americans -- 20 per day -- are killed annually by unlicensed drivers, and Rosenberg calculates that more than half are the victims of illegal immigrants. Now, by testifying before lawmakers, speaking to parents who have been through the same ordeal and posting his research on his nonprofit__ website, unlicensedtodrive.org, Rosenberg is shedding light on a frightening number not readily available from government sources.

BRIC found the majority of individuals arrested last year for Class A drug trafficking in the city of Boston were not U.S. citizens and most of those non-citizens were Dominican foreign nationals.

__n analysis of Class A Trafficking arrests showed that 39% of the arrestees claimed to have been born in the U.S., 26 percent claimed to have been born in Puerto Rico, and 65% were born in another country,_ BRIC stated in the report.

Of the non-citizen heroin traffickers arrested in Boston, 84 percent are from the Dominican Republic.

__his suggest heroin trafficking in Boston is largely controlled by Dominican drug organizations,_ the report states.

The report, which was shared with several state and federal agencies on Monday, is unclassified but has not been released to the public or to media.

Boston police suspect many non-citizens arrested for trafficking heroin may have also committed identity fraud, suggesting those traffickers are in the U.S. illegally.

__n 44% [of] cases where a person was arrested for Trafficking Class A in 2015 and 2016, and listed a place of birth other than the U.S., there were signs of past identity fraud or use of different names at booking,_ the report states. __n 59% of the cases where the suspect listed Puerto Rico as their place of birth, there were signs of identity fraud and use of aliases._

He worked for the Harrisonburg Votes which is affiliated with the Democratic party. His job was to walk around and get people registered to vote - registering people with any political affiliation not just registering democrats. No where on any article, including the statement from the Justice Dept. website, does anyone say which party he registered anyone with. 

He said he did it because he was worried he wasn't going to meet the registration quota that was set for him. His motivation had nothing to do with politics, it was a kid cheating on his job to meet a quota so he wouldn't look bad.

No voter fraud happened, it was all caught and investigated before they were submitted to the registrars office, so none of the forms even made it to being registered.

His charges aren't related to voter fraud but to falsifying the information on the documents.

He's serving 100-120 days in jail.

We hope you stop by and check out our community!

#1. You have almost 10,000 users and your sub was trending recently, all before Donald Trump was even sworn in as president. To what do you credit the attraction to the sub?

We have been thrilled with the level of interest we've already had. We don't think there would be any interest this early in an impeachment sub if any other candidate--democrat, republican, or """"third"""" party--had won. This is beyond just not liking his politics. Trump is extraordinarily different in his lack of qualification, lack of understanding of the role, and lack of temperamental suitability. As the president is relatively unconstrained in his use of nuclear weapons and in foreign affairs, many people find this especially worrying. To us, the interest is validating the belief that this impeachment talk is not just typical partisanship.

#2. Why should we begin a new chapter of America with a campaign to impeach the president before we give him a chance to be a good president?

We care a great deal about the constitution and the people, so, of course, our first choice would always be a successful Trump. With that said, he repeatedly demonstrated during the campaign and transition that he's unfit for the presidency. We have studied him closely, as many American's did during the election, and we think he will continue his previous patterns of discrimination, breaking the law, and putting his own interests first. We wish that wasn__ the case, but we can__ help but believe that impeachment is going to be a very important topic over the next 4 years whether we like it or not.

#3. Why impeach? Why not start preparations for state and federal offices in 2020?

We think those are great causes, too, and certainly not incompatible with our focus. We definitely encourage you to get involved in local elections for 2018 as well as 2020.

#4. Do you expect that Donald Trump will be impeached before 2020? And if so, what for? What do you think he's guilty of that rises to the level of impeachment? How also do you see it happening given that the House and Senate are GOP controlled?

We think he has already committed impeachable offenses (e.g. bribery), and there is no rule against being impeached for action taken before being sworn in.  [Check out our full arguments for his impeachment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Impeach_Trump/wiki/arguments).  We think it is possible even though there is a republican majority house and senate because many republicans openly dislike Trump and would prefer a President Pence, who would likely help the GOP politically and financially more than Trump.  Although Nixon resigned, he was impeached by his own party, so similar things have happened before.

#5. Trump is impeached. What then? Mike Pence is sworn in. Many might say his fundamentalist Christian views make him even worse than Trump. Does the impeach Pence campaign then begin?

Political differences are not grounds for impeachment, so, ***absolutely not***, we would not support efforts to impeach Pence.  We do not support the impeachment of Trump lightly, as it would be bad for democracy to automatically jump to impeachment talk any time a politician you don__ like wins.  We may not like Pence, but he acts within the bounds of the constitution.",,existenjoy,24,t3_5owf8a,dcmmeiz,t3_5owf8a,t5_2sgno,1484835924,0.099312,0.048924,0.067517,0.295657,0.153116,-0.637407,0.484023,0.540974,0.111089,0.599103,0.14231,-0.306882,0.59363216,Error!
