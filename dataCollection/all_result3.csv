It would probably make your parents day.

Edit:

I was an idiot growing up. I am an idiot now but it was more concentrated when I was younger. I have stories like this. I can't believe how selfish and obsintant I was. Failing grades, bad friends, getting into trouble all the time. Sometimes I wonder how they did it. I can't imagine the patience they must have had. Or the times of hurt that I truly caused.

I can remember many years ago (at least 2 decades) yelling at my father and telling him I didn't love him. That may seem small when you read it but I will never forget how his posture changed. He went into a slouched position and rested his face on his hands looking infinitely disappointed. There were a number of these situations.

Frankly I am very disappointed with myself for at least the first 20 years of my life.

Now I make sure to at least visit weekly and just talk or just listen. Sometimes on days that aren't holidays I like to do something nice to show them that I appreciate them. We have a closer relationship now then we ever did and that is good. I'll just never forget that I was a self centered outlandish twit a chunk of my life. It wasn't all bad but that's what I seem to focus on.

At a certain point you give up on the idea that neither the horse nor the castle are ever going to look any nearer or further away, and you stop looking.

The incline softens after a hundred yards or so, but it's still hardly flat, so you press on, scraping the very last vestiges of energy from the walls of a calorie store that was empty before you began your crazed assault.

And then, finally, gloriously, you reach the first of the scattered stones at the foot of the horse.  And there's a family there having a picnic as you bend over, snot and sweat streaming from your wretched face as your wracked lungs struggle for sweet, sweet air and, through all the pain, you realise: you've done it!  You made it up to the...

..and at that point a gang of super fit 17 year-olds from the rowing club catch up, nimbly skip over the stones to slap a hand on the horse's pedestal and then, nonchalantly and barely breaking stride, turn 180 degrees and head back to town.

3120,"I have a car insured with them so when I bought a second car I naturally called.  After all they boast they're *the* multi car specialists.  They wanted £550 for the second car, third party only.  Then they realised they hadn't accounted for a claim that I made two years ago when a TNT driver hit my brother's *parked* car while I happened to be responsible for it.  So the premium went up to £650, which for a limited-mileage classic stank of bullshit.  However, being away from home for a few days I went for it so I was legal and paid the £650 upfront.

When I got home I rang a specialist, got a quote for £200 and rang Admiral back.  Being within the 14 days I was entitled to a full refund.  """"Oh yes Mr Pineapplecharm, I will be refunding you the £345.62...""""

""""£650,"""" I corrected him.  """"I would like a full refund please.""""

""""No, that was paid up through June already, this doesn't affect the first car.  Even if it did, what I want is to go back to the situation I had a week ago and receive a full refund please as is my legal right.""""

""""No sir you are not understanding me.  You converted to a multi car policy with a multi car discount and now you are losing this the discount, isn't it.""""

Long story short, I became irate, asked for the manager, was told he wasn't there, invoked my rights as a customer of a financial services company and told them if I didn't get a refund I would hang up and call the police.  At that point he put me on hold for about 30 seconds after which he gave me my money back.

I am sure this is policy - try to trick people into relinquishing their rights in the hope that they will just back down.  It makes me livid to think of elderly or less assertive people losing money to these dicks just because they don't know their rights or won't stand up for them.

Cons - Prices will increase and due to the Royal Mail's incredibly low prices, they'll still be the market leader for postage in terms of pricing and service.

This is a deal where the general public can only lose. The Royal Mail already has the lowest prices and it has an extraordinary infrastructure, other postal companies couldn't dream of the network of post boxes and post offices that the Royal Mail has.

It is a profitable company, even though the pricing is exceptionally lower than """"competitors"""". The Royal Mail needs to be a state ran business with all profits put back into the country, not into private interests.

This isn't a stupid move on the part of government, this is an extremely selfish, malicious and self-serving decision. I've yet to hear a single argument as to the benefit of privatizing the Royal Mail.

Try sending a small to medium sized parcel, look at the prices of the Royal Mail then look at other postal companies, that's why the Royal Mail should stay state run, we will lose a postal business that is costs a fraction of other companies.

3183,"&gt; you should match the speed of the traffic in the lane you're in

Well yes obviously huge trucks which take upwards of a minute to pass each other are incredibly annoying (especially when they end up giving up and pulling back in, always a classic) but I'm talking about an increased level of frustration that is palpable when you drive under the limit.  In fact, I've heard from IAM instructors that driving more than 3mph under the limit is dangerous because it encourages people to take a risk and overtake.  Apparently if you're at the limit they are more likely to think, well, the risk of death *and* points isn't enough to bother.

The point, to me, is just that raising the speed limit increases the expected speed, the normal speed.  Whatever the safety stats say, there isn't a car made which doesn't tail off in efficiency over about 60mph.  Much as I love speed, I also love breathing and not being insanely poor.

As an aside, regarding """"I overtake on public roads at 85mph because it's safer"""" - do you really think for one second that a cop who clicks you doing *25mph over the limit on the wrong side of the road* is going to care about your opinion on road safety?  Enjoy your [on the spot driving ban](http://www.drivingban.co.uk/drivingban/speedingoffences/drivingbanspeedingoffences.htm#What_is_the_penalty_range/maximum_punishment_for_speeding_offences), Mr Clarkson!  If you can't overtake safely at 60 guess what.. *you're not supposed to overtake* and whinging at other people for driving completely legally (but inconveniently slowly for you) when you're happy to boast on the internet about breaking the law is just retarded.

Drive like a dick if you want but don't get sanctimonious about it.  Unless you drive an ambulance.

When you do any kind of a long journey at 60, and overtake trucks towing uphill at 55 on a two lane stretch, you definitely get impatient tailgaters who cannot wait for you to get done with their lane. This happens much less when you are around the 70 mark.

A part of safe overtaking is the speed you choose to do it at. This is exeplified on single-lane roads where you need to minimise the time spent on the wrong side of the road (hence why I get a run-up and do it at around 80-85).

It's the same on dual or triple carriageways though - you should match the speed of the traffic in the lane you're in. Although you may be happily chugging along doing 60, if you need to overtake someone doing 55, 5mph isn't really enough closing speed not to inconvenience others (as you're doing less than the average speed for the middle lane, and *dangerously* less than for the overtaking lane).

Actually, shared paternal leave usually does NOT lead to equal time spent with the child. In Iceland we've had a 3-3-3 month paternal leave in place since 2000. That is, 3 months a parent, and 3 months to be shared. After 10 years, the rate of how the leave was split was studied.

Most families(well over 90%) ended up giving ALL of those 3 months to the mother. But on the other hand, over 85% of men took their entire 3 months of their allotted leave, starting within about 20 days of the change of the law, and keeping pretty consistent ever since(with a obvious drop in 2008, but even now, the rate is again somewhere around 80%).

So clearly, men want to spend time with their child, but for whatever reason, be it social norms or some other, nearly always conceded their leave to the mothers. So in late 2012 the law was changed to a 5-2-5 arrangement. There are now 2 months to be split, and they are still sadly believed to end up meaning a essential 5/7 month split, but hopefully in the future that will change.

Some off the shelf consumer routers support putting wireless and wired networks on different VLANs which will also work. 

My suggestion (assuming the existing equipment cannot handle different DHCP scopes and you have to buy something) is that for about $100 you can put a consumer router off the modem that will have a guest SSID on a different VLAN.

Gah, busted.  I'll send in my internet license for the endorsements!

Seriously, though, it doesn't half wind me up when people say things like """"dangerously slow for the overtaking lane"""".  Dangerous and inconsiderate driving can be within the letter of the law, of course, but there's no different speed limit, upper or lower, for particular lanes of a motorway and as a considerate road user you should be ready for anyone, in any lane, to be doing any speed from 40 up, if road and traffic conditions are appropriate.  To argue otherwise is to drift into saying """"if I'm doing 70 I should just stay in the middle lane"""" and risk ULTRAVIOLENT DEATH.",t1_c4nwonj,pineapplecharm,1,t1_c4nwda7,c4nwonj,t3_tm8us,t5_2qhqb,1337013224,c4nwda7,"&gt; As an aside, regarding """"I overtake on public roads at 85mph because it's safer"""" - do you really think for one second that a cop who clicks you doing 25mph over the limit on the wrong side of the road is going to care about your opinion on road safety? Enjoy your on the spot driving ban, Mr Clarkson! If you can't overtake safely at 60 guess what.. you're not supposed to overtake and whinging at other people for driving completely legally (but inconveniently slowly for you) when you're happy to boast on the internet about breaking the law is just retarded.
&gt; Drive like a dick if you want but don't get sanctimonious about it. Unless you drive an ambulance. Do you drive an ambulance?

Bit of a rant there! The point is that when overtaking, I try to get the deed done as quickly as possible. The most dangerous place to be is on the wrong side of the road.

Similarly, if there were a camera or police car and I did that, then I obviously didn't have enough visibility to attempt the manoeuvre in the first place so I deserve the punishment! :)",t1_c4nwda7,JamesM_,5,t1_c4nvzyw,c4nwda7,t3_tm8us,t5_2qhqb,1337011745,0.196025,0.013856,0.301214,0.076297,0.740265,-0.252992,0.476368,0.732706,0.422994,0.43166,0.574311,-0.48409,0.18803392,0.5086875
3313,"&gt; provided there is traffic on the left lane that I am passing

This is the key.  Of course all three lanes are there to be used.  However, if there's room for somebody to undertake you and pull back out without crowding your safe stopping distance, you should not have been in the middle or outside lane.

&gt; The only catch here is that every motorist has to know what each lane is for and where they should be in the scheme of things.

This is bullshit, sadly.  Making up """"what each lane is for"""" is just justifying what's convenient for your lazy driving style.  If the lane you're in is holding you up, move right.  If the lane to your left is clear, move left.  It's that simple, and it's in the highway code I quoted above.

Changing lanes, however frequently, isn't dangerous.  If it is, you're doing it wrong.  If anything, constantly watching to see if there's room to pull in - and doing so - keeps your mind on the job.  Banging on the cruise control and zoning out in the middle lane when there's a clear half mile of empty space on the inside lane is much more conducive to being surprised by something unusual.

I think our Venn circles mostly overlap on this.  It's just that you see lane-hogging as a harmless extension of normal behaviour whereas I see it as irritating and dangerous lawbreaking.

Incidentally, your housemate is obviously [Damon Hill](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3NSMx7Ev5A).",t1_c2df4xp,pineapplecharm,2,t1_c2deyhn,c2df4xp,t3_jmmcj,t5_2qh33,1313689282,c2deyhn,"Lets expand on that. 

My ex-house mate drove the way you suggested on a three lane motorway a few weeks ago and by the end of the trip I felt positively sick. Why? Because he was forever dodging left and right to overtake traffic then pull over again. 

Legally he was spot on but practically I think it's far more dangerous. Why? Because aside from making me feel ill he was having to make tens if not hundreds more manoeuvres than everyone around him - constantly changing lanes and merging with traffic (both faster and slower). This radically upped his chances of making a mistake or having an issue with a motorist he didn't see. 

On the other hand there was everyone else - cruising happily with the slowest traffic in the far left hand lane (as it should be), the marginally faster traffic in the central lane and the fastest / overtaking traffic in the right hand lane. No moving all over the road... no rapid acceleration or deceleration... just driving. 

I know which one I would prefer. 

Add to that the effect that if *everyone* is in the left hand lane except to overtake you end up with massive tailbacks as a result of traffic waiting for other traffic to pass, decelerating to merge into the left hand lane and generally trying to fit in. Sure you can overtake in these conditions but it's so much smoother and simpler to spread out and make use of every lane. The only catch here is that every motorist has to know what each lane is for and where they should be in the scheme of things. 

Short version? I'm happy cruising in the central lane of a three lane motorway - provided there is traffic on the left lane that I am passing and faster traffic to my right that is passing me. I won't be in anyones way and will manoeuvre as dictated by motorists around me to ensure I can pass / stay out of other peoples way. No fuss, nice and simple.

&gt; touring the countryside, visiting small towns, seeing the neat old farms, historic buildings and castles and just wandering around

Seriously, go and check out the Lakes and Cotswolds; you will go nuts.  The former is best if you want to hike across country, the latter is a bit more for driving to a cute town and looking at old inns and shops.

Whatever you do, investigate online for events and such - it's the prime time of year for beer festivals, arts fairs and bizarre sporting events like rubber duck races - so you have at least a couple of things in mind.  That said, you'll have the most fun if you have the flexibility to just do whatever takes your fancy as you walk past a handwritten sign saying """"Farmers market this way &gt;&gt;&gt;"""".

This is a bit of a disturbing statement; if you are saying you are willing to put essentials on credit cards to live better...

Using a credit card to cover unexpected budget shortfalls is how a lot of people wind up with debt that takes years to pay off.

Using a credit card to pay for expected budget items (essentials) so that you can up your standard of living means you would be falling deeper into debt every month, and at an accelerating rate because of the interest.

Perhaps there is just a misunderstanding there?

In any case, what are you proposing is precisely how most people that come into large sums of money end up in a WORSE position than before they had it. People get the money, and they buy a house. And they furnish the house, and they buy a nicer car, and they feel like are being frugal with the money because they didn't spend all of it, or most of it, maybe they didn't even spend a quarter of it.

But the problem is that the cost of maintaining the new things is higher than their income, so every year they chip away at that original large sum of money, and every year the income generated by that sum of money goes down. But they think it will be OK, because the figure that the expenses will 'stabilize' and their income will rise and that this will happen before the money runs out.

Instead the expenses only go up, their income doesn't rise as fast as they hope, and then their investments have a bad year, and a few unexpected expenses come up, and suddenly the money is gone, and by the time they sell the house and try to get back to a standard of living their income can afford, they're in debt.",,stampedingTurtles,14,t3_4jpdl4,d38rp1j,t3_4jpdl4,t5_2qstm,1463492983,0.409017,0.243005,0.140233,0.09982,0.288923,-0.511874,0.32778,0.187319,0.464738,0.105269,0.209104,-0.236391,0.29382947,0.06318641

&gt;you act like """"I'm a late one"""" is somehow a charming character trait, like being funny or having red hair

or calling yourself pineapplecharm, aren't you cute and lovely.

Lets say you are training to be a teacher and you are assigned a school two trains and a taxi ride away that requires you to be up at 6 **A.M** am, resulting in a winter term of no daylight and 4x35 rebellious teenagers on rotation every day (I was very very lucky to not have a first period lesson), resulting in an average of *4 hours sleep* a night for 6 months through lesson planning and homework marking, which causes you to oversleep and wake up in horror as you launch out of bed and have to run across town for a train, which you cant afford to pay for on your 4k bursary.

Meanwhile all your mates are stitting in a pub at 7pm on friday slagging you off because being late is apparently a deliberately rude thing to do through my personal failure to balance in their  needs, with my own body's demands for sleep. 

If I do make it out, I am apparently boring,  if I dont go, apparently I have better things to do. 


&gt;I was like you for a long time.

&gt;You also get to hear what everyone says about late people before they show up.

If you cant beat em, join em. eh? 

I never used to be like you used to be. And I am not like you now either. 

Also, I am not a teacher either. Not even 30k butsary they offer to train these days would tempt me back into a class full of you lot unless I have control of the curriculum or the birch or you learn the concept of community responsibility.

Still, I do understand your annoyance and I still think the eyeballing was the correct level of attack and no more. I am sorry that you have such a lot of anger left over about the experience, perhaps you could try communicating with your housemate 

Please stop throwing your assumptions at strangers, and slagging off others behind their back in the morning at work.

But as someone who was once a teenage girl growing up in a white area, older men preying on you is part of parcel of life. I remember many girls at school having 'older boyfriends', who would wait outside school for them, buy them perfume etc. They were usually working class and from troubled homes, and there were quite often rumours of them being passed around their friends.

7:30 is too late to leave it to get back to Gatwick, Stansted, or Luton for a 9:00pm flight. You need to be there at 7:00 at the *latest* really, some people may disagree but its better to be safe than sorry - the lowco's will leave you behind and make you buy a new ticket if you are late. For all these airports you need to take the underground to a major London train terminus then catch a train out to them.

It's also really pushing it for Heathrow IMO. Heathrow is accessible by the underground direct but its on the outskirts and takes a while. There is also an expensive fast train to central London, but it would quickly deplete a chunk of your budget.

If your flight arrives at 2:00pm then it will probably be 3:00pm before you even get out of the airport. Do you need to collect luggage and then check it in again later? 

So with all that said you probably have more like 3 hours. First read the wiki for some advice. You could have a bit of a walk and catch a few famous landmarks and a bite to eat.

Let you have what?  I'm not rich enough to pick Internet fights with *lawyers*.  Although I would surmise that if being rich wouldn't save me from ignorance of American law then being British, and a resident in London, might help me a little bit.  At least you're less of a stereotypical legal twatburger than your pizza-named colleague over there.

The rather sad part of this sort of thing is that at a macro level the entire legal system exists, at least in part, precisely to stop big tough rich people from simply stomping all over everyone else.  500 years ago if you were Lord of the manor and some peasant pissed you off, he would have just had you killed - because what the fuck was your widow going to do about it?  Now we've put in all the framework to make even the most powerful accountable for their actions... and then paid clever bastards like you handsomely to undermine the whole thing.  Bloody marvellous.

Lord knows you could have let me have it - I certainly pulled no punches.

&gt; So, just to be clear, this means AirBnB and its users can't take each other to court for any reason? So if AirBnB are somehow found guilty in a court of criminal negligence that has cost a user money they would only have recourse individually through arbitration, and there's legal precedent for that being upheld? Blimey. That's quite a heavy click I'd be making there.

There is a lot here, so I'll break it down:

1. You can still enter lawsuits to get injunctions, just not to go after money damages.
2. Criminal law is just totally outside of the scope of this stuff. If airbnb is found criminally negligent then it is going to wind up in court no matter what - but this doesn't matter for you as a private citizen. Governments sue for criminal negligence, not private citizens, and yes, in fact, if Airbnb were found to be criminally liable for damage the civil suit *might* still be dead in the stable because of this clause. It may vary slightly from state to state and on the type of damage alleged, but yes, this is the whole point, and criminally responsible parties can still be found not to have civil liability specifically for these reasons. Again, that is going to vary a lot - but the odds of any of this stuff rising to the level of criminality is very low anyway. 
* In general, yes, the only recourse is individually through binding arbitration. Whether or not this means Airbnb users can sue each other is something I haven't really thoughtabout - its a definite """"maybe / I don't know.""""
* As above, there are exceptions, but there is a truckload of caselaw upholding this in all sorts of circumstances where even I, as a soulless suit, have thought """"damn, that's harsh."""" For instance, binding arbitration and waiver of class action has been upheld against walmart in systematic workers sexual discrimination lawsuits - which is just... sanity-blasting to me. Additionally, binding arbitration has been upheld as a matter of routine in *clickwrap* contracts which is also very worrisome to me - and it has been upheld in all manner of gruesome cases of personal injury, enormous financial losses and property damage.
* Yes, it **is** a heavy click - but don't worry, dotcomrade! Strong odds are that you've already made that click several times *today.* Reddit, twitter and facebook don't appear to have it - but I can assure you that many, many, many websites do.

*  a prohibition on any exercise other than jogging, playing a musical instrument, taking part in a __athering of any kind_, giving a speech or address, scattering ashes, releasing a balloon and flying a kite.

* An __nhanced_ CCTV system would monitor visitors for lawbreaking or prohibited activities

*  security staff known as """"visitor hosts"""" who would have limited policing powers under a Community Safety Accreditation Scheme, including the right to issue fines.

*  bag searches or __and_ scans of people__ clothing could be used, but only, for example, if a VIP was visiting the bridge.

* The bridge would close overnight, and occasionally in evenings, for private events.

* the bridge would be off limits to groups of eight or more people and to cyclists.

*  the charity proposes to rent the rooftop of the bridge's landing podium for commercial purposes on every weekend between May and October.

""""Due diligence"""" and """"common sense"""" are basically useless, which are what gun control is. It doesn't matter if people have rocket launchers or machine guns. It only matters WHO has them.

The reality is, when you put a gun in someone's possession, you have removed from your trust a grave responsibility and put it into another person's trust. 

If someone wants a gun, they will try to get one, regardless of their fitness to hold this trust or their motive. The only place where rational incentives and trust can possibly hold is with the seller. 

If you sell your AR-15 to a guy in the classifieds without any investment into his character, history, family, friends, etc, then you are literally no better than the retired cop who sold the gun to the Orlando nut, who literally said __e__ a nobody. He__ a customer. He came and purchased his guns and he left. We do a large business._ 

We hand over killing tools with less concern than we hand over medicine or car keys. We have the entire picture backwards. Killers will not be disincentivized by the law's punishment.

I could have been honest and owned up to my shortcomings.

A worn gearbox usually needs a complete rebuild to eliminate noise because the various gears, if re-aligned on new bearings, will continue to howl when different wearing surfaces are presented to each other.

3594,"In most developed countries the line would be """"do everything you can to avoid an accident"""" and the matter of whether hitting someone saved other more numerous lives would be left for courts to decide in individual cases.  Additionally, in Europe in particular, strict vehicle inspection and seatbelt law means that swerving would not be a terrible risk for the passengers of most vehicles.  However in most of Africa, vehicles are often in a poor state of repair with bald tyres, shot shocks and the like, as well as being regularly overloaded with unsecured passengers, which makes anything other than straight-line progress highly risky.

High speed roads are also better isolated from pedestrian traffic - I've *never* seen livestock or people (except those who have pulled over) on the motorway in Europe but I've seen cows, horses and drunken pedestrians stumbling into the path of 70mph traffic many times in countries south of the Med.

While it is of course possible to dream up a situation where this sort of decision might have to happen on the Autobahn, I think it's much more an edge case than in rural Africa, as evidenced by the lack of *exhortation to commit deliberate manslaughter* in the government-issued driving instruction literature, certainly here in the UK.

The feel of them around my neck is one of the most deeply unpleasant sensations. I constantly feel like I'm about to be choked.

The last time I wore a tie was when I was delivering an educational presentation for the company which then employed me. The next time I wore a shirt with a mandarin collar* to make it very, VERY clear that I had not forgotten to wear a tie, I was consciously refusing to.

Did the presence of a tie improve my performance? Quite the opposite. I felt more confident and alert without 20% of my mind being taken up by a little voice screaming """"GET THAT NOOSE OFF YOUR NECK BEFORE SOMEONE CHOKES YOU!""""

Then it was shoes. My current employer requires I wear 'smart shoes' Again, I refuse. Walking in normal shoes is awkward for me. The majority of them destroy my feet. I get unbalanced easily too. So I wear boots. Big ones. Millsurp for preference. I know where I'm putting my feet, they're comfortable and they are more respectable than trainers (which I also don't wear).

It seemed to be a bit of an issue at first but I keep my boots clean. Did not having fancy footwear impact my work? Well if my last review and pay rise are anything to go by - no.

If you want someone representing your company, it's perfectly reasonable to expect them to look smart, respectable and professional. However a dress code is a cheap, nasty little fools errand to achieve that. I'm a grown man. I know how to dress myself. I know how to dress for a given occasion. I don't need my employer to spoon feed me on how to look and act like a professional as I am a professional.

And I'm a far better professional who represents the better qualities of my employer when I wear an open neck (or mandarin) shirt and a pair of clodhoppers. When I wear a tie and shoes I'm a fidgety mess who needs an extra few seconds to answer every question, trips over his own feet and gets easily distracted.

And that's with 'normal' shoes. I find it absurd that a woman should be expected to wear something as uncomfortable, impractical, and downright unhealthy as high heels.

If you want people to look professional, hire professionals. If you want to hire a face, hire that face. Dress policies are mostly an attempt to paint a company to look like something that it may well not be.

*Hate ties as well? Get one of these and see if you can get away with it.

*Edit*

Wow, some people have really strong feelings about people who don't like dress codes. 

Anyway, it's been fun responding to these comments. No idea why not wearing a tie seems to piss some of you off so much, but my lunch break's over and I have to deliver some training.

AFAIK - and I have to get on site because all the guy I spoke to can see in the office say """"switch"""" on it - they just have a standard ADSL router; I'm guessing that one of those little things won't what you're describing but if it will, this is an excellent suggestion.  Alternatively, if I need to buy one, is this level of routing called something for which I can check the specs?

The tills / office are all wired in (through the switch) so there's no security problem *yet*, as long as the router doesn't allow traffic between the WAP and the office IP range.  I will investigate further once I get up there.",t1_c4j5ckt,pineapplecharm,1,t1_c4j3z2u,c4j5ckt,t3_t3105,t5_2qkaf,1335964671,c4j3z2u,"I don't know your set up so you would have to provide more information on what exact you are working with. For example """"some standard box"""" doesn't tell us if its a switch, router, modem, firewall, etc. 

On to your question. There are multiple ways to do this. I'm going to say what I think is the easiest (doesn't mean it's the best).

But assuming """"some standard box"""" is a router, you can just purchase a wireless access point. Remember each port on a router has the ability to act as a different network. The purpose of a router is to join multiple networks together.

Port 1 can be 192.168.0.0-192.168.0.255 

port 2 can be 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255

port 3 can be 192.168.2.0-192.168.2.255

So essentially you are creating two networks with 1 router. 

In your case, you would keep the router's wifi on and give that an address range. Then have a port plug into a WAP and give that a range as well. Of course a different range than the first wifi. Or you can stick a toe in the water and make subnets.

Since you are wireless, the question becomes how well will your router play along? It should work fine I believe but can't make any promises. I'm only thinking conceptually. 


Now the 1 million dollar question you should be asking your boss is what about security? You are already wireless. At this point it doesn't matter if they are on the same network or not. Your data is already in the air for anyone to grab. That means credit card numbers, tax info, etc. Anything that is important should not be wireless. Technically as it stands now, your data can be grabbed out of the air. Unless you are using WPA2 AES or something, you run the risk of a data breach (even then no promises). 

Plus now you must also consider how this affects network traffic. If your network already has an issue with speed for the basic business stuff, then adding on more clients who will be using data like crazy (youtube, itunes, files) can slow down the whole network depending on how you go about this.


As for the firewall idea if I'm understanding how you are planning to set that up, it can work. Probably more hassle then it needs to be. In that case you would need 1 NIC and 2 wifi cards and all your traffic would have to be routed through Pfsense. Then pfsense becomes your DHCP host because each network is it's own thing. Then this goes back to how you are currently set up. This can also add another bottle neck. 

So like I said before I'm only think conceptually. You have to give us specifics on how your network is currently laid out. Not asking for model numbers but what connects in to what, how it is connected, what devices are present, etc.",t1_c4j3z2u,gex80,1,t3_t3105,c4j3z2u,t3_t3105,t5_2qkaf,1335950292,0.158093,0.148275,0.122351,0.039869,0.066144,0.474003,0.219978,0.517871,0.11814,0.543729,0.127996,-0.0617364,0.01957212,0.10789466

I get what you're saying about honouring great scientists but by the same logic we'd only have economists on bank notes. It's a great opportunity not just to honour a great person but to reference something recognisable from popular culture. When I were a lad my junior school named the years/grades after a different theme each academic year. Famous architects,  or geological eras for example. At the time they were just words but when I came across them later in my childhood you can bet I was the only twelve year-old in the room whose ears pricked up at the mention of Palladio or Silurian.

This is an element so fleeting in nature that we got to 2015 before someone managed to create one atom of it. I'm sure it will be of interest to an elite class of physicists but to the rest of us,  who invest in such research through our taxes and University fees,  it's hard to see its relevance. Not taking the opportunity to make people engage with such breakthroughs is a mistake.  I submit that the naming of it is more about making science familiar and interesting than a strict league table of hero worship, and the opportunity presented by this specific confluence of name, meaning and nature is too good to pass up.

I've read several of the Discworld books and I love them, but this is a stretch. There are some funny references to scientific principles and experiments, but I wouldn't say the books convey any meaningfully deep knowledge of science; certainly not enough to warrant Pratchett's immortalisation alongside Curie, Einstein, Fermi, Bohr, Mendeleev, Rutherford, Röntgen, Copernicus *et al.*. Their discoveries have provided meaningful insight into the way nature works and have advanced entire fields of study; the impact they have had on modern science has been profound. They weren't chosen for making people vaguely aware of science, but for changing the way we think about the universe. 

Terry, whilst being an incredibly entertaining writer and offering some clever critique and satire on society, hasn't contributed to our understanding of natural phenomena in any meaningful way. As much as I am a fan, I think it would be wholly inappropriate to name an element after him. I think it would be much more appropriate to pay tribute to him in a way that was related to his contributions to the world; i.e. naming some kind of literature prize, or library or something relating to one of his genuine interests (arguably the GNU Terry Pratchett, the sea turtle fossil that's named after him, maybe some astronomical object would be appropriate).

Using that definition, I don't think they've gotten their numbers right.

The median annual income in Westminster is £35,200. Assuming that someone working part time earns half of that (£17,600/year), you have a total income of £52,800/year between two people. You shouldn't be spending more than 1/3 of your income on accommodation, meaning this couple have £1467/month to spend on accommodation. That won't afford you a two-bed penthouse by the river, but that budget is not unheard of in the northern parts of the borough.

Shelter is saying that the cost of renting is ~~50% higher than the (total) combined take home pay, meaning £6,600/month for our average couple~~ higher than 50% of the (total) combined take home pay, meaning £2,200, or £1,759.94 after tax as /u/cyclegaz mentions (I wasn't aware that my initial figures were pre-tax).

Ha ha """"might"""".  I'm sure we've all had this conversation with a recruiter:

&gt; """"So it says you're confident with setting up PHP/MySQL, particularly on Linux based Apache?""""

&gt; """"Yes.""""

&gt; """"What about LAMP?""""",,pineapplecharm,3,t1_cxsoed8,cxsr7f3,t3_3w065x,t5_2qs0q,1449666692,cxsoed8,"&gt; This is not good advice. There's no reason to ever put JSON on your resume/linkedin.

For someone who is actively looking for a job, the skill list is basically a SEO keyword list for HR departments and recruiting agencies, who might be absolutely clueless about what all the various abbreviations mean. This doesn't mean the company looking for talent is clueless or bad either, it's simply difficult to find really good developers and many of them have to resort to agencies that can give them leads.

They have a stack of words associated with the projects the company is doing and look for candidates who have experience with them. The actually relevant details of your profile (e.g. work experience, projects) won't matter if you never show up, or are deep in the list when it comes to candidate relevancy.

Should the HR ask a developer to check your LinkedIn profile (which isn't always the case anyway), they focus in what you've worked on and what your interests are, if you've got a Github link etc, not if you've listed something in the skills section that isn't necessarily a skill.

Is JSON a keyword that appears in many talent searches? I don't know, but if you have room and need a job, there's no harm in including it for maximum visibility. You could have the exact same argument over a bunch of libraries and tools as well. If you are very concerned over how the skill list portrays you, drop the nonsense to the bottom and hide any endorsements from them to make the important bits stand out.

Overall LinkedIn is mostly a bullshit circlejerk where people endorse each other to stand out and try to look important, but it has proven incredibly valuable in finding developer talent/jobs, so it's a good idea to bite the bullet and SEO the shit out of your profile when you look for a job.

Let's say you arrange to meet your mate at 7pm and you know it takes about half an hour to get there.  If you aim to leave the house at 6:30 you are already late.  Seriously, it's two days before and you've already made the decisions that will lead to you being late.  Because if you reach a natural break in what you're doing come 6:15 you won't leave the house and be early, you'll start some other horseshit task, and come 6:35 you'll still be looking for your fucking shoes instead of being on the bus already.  And then you're late, and your mate who did leave at 6:15 is sat there reading the adverts on the tube platform, or defending his solo occupancy of a table in a crowded pub, until your sweaty, stressed-out self shows up.

Being late is a form of selfishness; it's rude not to value others' scheduled time over your flexible time.  When you refuse to run the risk of being early, because you can totally just squeeze in something before you leave, you're guaranteeing you will always be late.

I was like you for a long time, constantly making up bullshit excuses and exaggerating about the District Line not showing up, all because I couldn't even entertain the thought of standing around waiting for someone else like a loser.  Carrying a Kindle helped me a lot; I would look forward to being ten or fifteen minutes early to things because I'd get to read my book for a bit.  And not being """"a late one"""" changes your life; it's incredibly liberating when the tube is delayed on the way to something important and you can relax about it and consider your options instead of being torn apart by miserable self loathing.

When we got to Kentish Town we were told that service was halting there due to power problems. I got off train and tried to call my boss to say I was going to be late. No Vodafone signal. No tube either so I was still cursing transport. Jumped on a bus. Weird but in those days smartphones weren't very common so I still didn't have a clue what was going on. Then someone on the bus got a call and they said """"The put a bomb on a bus. I better get off then"""". I knew something was wrong then. The bus stopped at Great Portland Street, and there were sirens ambulances and police cars everywhere. I knew then something very bad indeed had happened to London. Felt a little tear at that point.

Still no Vodafone and a queue for every phonebox (I know 11 years ago but a different world) so just walked to the office in Regent Street. Came through the door, and the MD crossed himself. I was the last unaccounted for member of staff. I asked my colleague what the deal was and he said there had been bombs at every tube station and there were two jumbo jets in the sky poised to hit London at any second.

Strangely the West End had an air of normality, shops were open, and in Camden Town street drinkers carried on about their business as if nothing had happened.

I talk to my parents about things I remember like this all the time and they barely ever know what I'm  talking about.

I was generally pretty well-behaved as a kid but one time when my Dad came home from a business trip to New York he brought back a Hardy Boys book for my brother and a Nancy Drew book for me (I'm a guy...) so I threw the book on the floor and made a big deal of how it was for girls and was a stupid present. 

Another time, we had planned for ages to go see Home Alone 2, and I was super excited. The day we were supposed to go, it snowed really heavily and my Dad said it would be better not to go as he thought the car might not be able to handle it (I grew up in a remote area and the nearest cinema was 45mins away through a fairly hilly area.) 

So, I start crying and yelling, saying """"you promised!!"""" over and over again and eventually my Dad gives in. Halfway there, the car breaks down and we're stuck in the middle of nowhere in the freezing cold for ages. The car gets towed, and costs a huge amount to get fixed. We get a lift home from my aunt and don't get to see Home Alone 2 so I continue to complain like a little shit.

In my head over the years I let memories of these things grow into a big guilt bubble and would feel really bad, like it was this horrific moment in my Dad's parenting life, but when I eventually brought it up with him he said he didn't even remember about the book and that he was preoccupied at the time because he got sick on the trip, and only vaguely remembered the car story!

No, it didn't. Homesite was one of the first casualties in a long line of web related products that Adobe mismanaged and mangled. It was supposedly """"integrated"""" into Dreamweaver, which meant adopting a handful of its features, but losing all of its refinement and developer focus. I personally continued using Homesite long after Adobe stopped supporting it. DW was not cutting it, even back then. 

It was Macromedia which made all of the innovations. I can only surmise the corporate culture at Adobe forced out the original talent, as the existing mindset systematically ruined everything web related to this day. 

Flash continued to thrive for a short while, in spite of Adobe, not because of it. It's current obsolete status and fervent abandonment by the web development community is indicative of Adobe's product development. 

DreamWeaver exists only because of its packaging with Adobe's mainstay programs, like cable channels you happen to watch because they're included, and a small outlier of developers addicted to its """"Site management"""" feature. 

In the DW world, ftp is still relevant, and jQuery is the only code hinting that matters. It's not time to reconsider DreamWeaver, it's time to kill it, so something useful can take its place.

Let's say that the Daily News published a front-page story all about how some woman apprehended a robber in a shop and did all these great things, and it comes to light that they got the name of the shop wrong. I don't believe it would be proportional for them to have to publish another front-page story about how they got the name wrong, and I don't think it would be useful for them to simply print another front page with the name corrected.

3977,"Okay mate, good stuff. 

I have had several times in my life when I've trained right alongside team mates who have made steady progress in building strength while I've swiftly plateaued. I'm sure that if I ate egg whites and trained five hours a day things could be different but if 12 hours a week on the river and 6 hours in the gym, for two years, doesn't give me anything other than (to be fair,  robust) stamina, I don't think I'm hiding behind a label saying I'm not the kind of person who puts on muscle easily.

People who can get fat often tend to bulk up easily too, once they make the effort, and it sometimes makes them insufferable """"anyone can do it if I can"""" gymvangelists. But it's not true of everyone.

The difference between me and those objecting to the adverts is I make an effort to be healthy,  so despite not looking anything like a swimwear model I don't feel envious guilt about it.

I'm also no health expert, so if I've offended you with a technically incorrect word I apologise. I got it from Arnie's book I think.",,pineapplecharm,-6,t1_d4818gb,d48243b,t3_4nxhzw,t5_2qh13,1465863183,d4818gb,"&gt; (ectomorph ftw)

No such thing.

&gt;  and for a while I've been eating well and have spent the last year regularly working out. While I'm maintaining a fit physique in my mid thirties I don't have any muscle definition to speak of.

Probably because of a poor diet and poor lifting routine. I turn 41 in less than a month and have no problem maintaining low body fat with muscle mass. The only supplement I take is a multivitamin.

&gt; the assumption that with a few quick trips to the gym we can all look like a movie star is just as unhealthy as this fat-pandering of Khan's.

3978,"The main protagonist came across as an idiot to me.  The conversations between him and the computer were stilted, void of content and dull, so I felt no affinity for either of them as characters and didn't believe they fell in love because, well, there was so little with which *to* fall in love.

I felt the technological detail, in particular of the installation, was jarringly unrealistic, which I think wrenched me out of the film's world.  Although I don't recall exactly why now I think it was just plainly obvious that it was inferring too much from too little and generally guilty of the usual Hollywood-science problem where the people writing the screenplay don't think it's important to involve anyone who knows what they're on about.  """"Let's do the installation scene,"""" they say, and throw some graphics and slightly cryptic jargon at the audience to patronise them a bit.  It was only one step removed from an eighties montage for all the thought that had gone into it.

It bothered me that this super intelligent AI system didn't figure out what his needs were.  It seemed like a cop out that he had so little self-awareness about the fact that he was just reflecting his own personality back onto himself through a digital filter.  And the ending was simultaneously predictable, and so obvious that it kind of surprised me but in an irritating way, as if they'd deliberately gone for something that didn't tie up any loose ends not because it was whimsical and thought-provoking, but just to piss me off and leave the story with no proper closure.

I know this is all really vague but it was, what, two years ago now?  I know that's ironically annoying and if this was about a film I liked it would seem like a pretty vacuous critique.

i am from canada where weed is consumed pretty openly and by people from most walks of life. but here i do lots of stuff that would be done by weed consumers in canada and there are just ciggies and booze and then probably grosser drugs that need to be done privately. which makes me think i miss the social acceptability of weed and the 'my man' type kinship that develops from someone asking you if you want to smoke a joint more than smoking weed itself.
