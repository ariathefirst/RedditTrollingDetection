&gt;They very well might not find any collusion! That's a very distinct possibility.

&gt;Still doesn't mean Trump isn't a criminal in other ways - money laundering, tax evasion, obstruction of justice, fraud, conspiracy, etc. Nor does it excuse the fact that he's apparently surrounded himself with unsavory criminal figures.

&gt;Also, you do realize that Mueller wasn't directed to investigate """"collusion"""", right? He was directed to investigate any """"links and/or &gt;coordination"""" between the Trump campaign associates and the Russian government. From that, he was authorized to investigate and charge for any crimes discovered.

&gt;Guess what?

&gt;We already know Trump campaign associates had """"links and/or coordination"""" with the Russian government. The only question that remains is whether or not Mueller will find actual criminal behavior...

Summary - 

* Many lines of inquiry remain, some of which have been addressed only in part and others not at all.
* More than 30 key witnesses that the Committee has yet to interview. Includes those who never responded to interview request, witnesses that the Majority did not agree to call in for testimony or request docs from, and other pertinent new witnesses discovered recently.
* The Committee has more than 20 entities from which they were unable to request documents before the investigation was shutdown: including Deutsche Bank, the Estate of Peter Smith (and associated entities), the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce in the USA, and social media companies. 
* Appendix D outlines more than 15 persons and entities for which the Committee believes compulsory process for appearance and/or document production to the Committee is necessary. Included are witnesses who have refused to appear; who have invoked a nonexistent privilege to avoid pertinent testimony or who have simply refused to answer questions because the answers may be adverse to the interests of the President or his campaign; who have not produced any documentation; or whose production was insufficient and for whom we have a reasonable basis to believe that they possess documents responsive to the Committee__ investigation. This list includes, among others: Donald Trump Jr., Michael Cohen, Jared Kushner, Hope Hicks, Attorney General Sessions, Erik Prince, and the White House. The Committee must also initiate a contempt process to compel Stephen Bannon to testify to the Committee fully and without constraints.


Also...

&gt; The Minority sent a document request on March 7,
2018 to **Reddit** and Tumblr, which the Majority declined to join.

**TLDR:** The Committee had a shitload more questions to answer, a ton of people to interview, and a fuck load of documents to obtain. It seems the Majority on the Committee blockaded and obstructed at every opportunity, and provided cover for those being investigated to find ways to avoid scrutiny.

That is according to crowd strike. The 17 IC all saying Russia is a blatant repeated lie. The report put out was intentionally misleading using weasel language. They said """"we believe"""" and are """"consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts"""". So in other non weasel word, we dont fucking know.

Here is what we DO know. 

The DNC refused to turn over the servers to the FBI.

They altered the DATA before copying it THEN turned it over.

The person leaking the emails, who you guys call a """"Russian agent"""" has never been wrong or had to retract anything has said it was leaked. (I know this doesnt mean fuck all to you)

Trump wanted to work WITH Russia since before this """"hack"""", and so did the voters. We can see the EUs direction and dont like it.

Manafort, like everyone is Washington has a long list of contacts. You need to make a case other then """"he had contact"""". That doesnt mean fuck all. He doesnt even have the capacity to enact or get rid of sanctions and he got fucking canned.

There is undoubtedly some connections between some people close to Trump and Russia, but that isnt illegal. Using the same parameters you label """"collusion"""" and """"treason"""" we can arrest 90% of the politicians in D.C. 

I believe whole heartily the Collusion narrative is created completely by the DNC for the 2018 elections. Because they were able to blame the loss on the leaks, and Trump's affinity for Russia and respect of Putin they created this boogey man over night. Not only does this narrative alleviate all the blame that should fall squarely on the DNC it gives them a rock solid reason why they had surveillance on Trump's associates during the election and a battle cry to try to rustle up support for a committee in shambles. They went from untrustworthy cheaters with disdain for their constituents and their choices to this benevolent force fighting this heinous treasonous act with the flip of a switch.

Overnight we went from noone can topple our strong democracy being repeated from every news outlet to Facebook ADS are breaking the very fabric of our democracy, its insane. This is all a rich mans trick to keep people in power they want. What we have now, what this community is, and the hordes of people who see Russian behind every comment and every news story are simply the last kicks of a dying animal. The benevolent line didn't work, the other side is racist line didn't work, billions of dollars didn't work, fingers in every MSM outlet didn't work. So they said fuck it, there is a reason this wasn't a issue before they lost. 

This is the only line they could of taken without looking like wannabe dictators abusing the IC to retain power. This is the only line that minimizes the humiliating loss. This is the only line that makes fucking Podesta and the DNC look like poor victims and its the only line that had a chance of saving face. They know Trump has business ties all over picked this one because of the left over cold war feelings and fucking ran with it. 

At the end of the day, the think tank that thought this up really is fucking brilliant and I cant blame them after such a humiliating loss. And to be honest with you, Trump is a fucking idiot and resorting to this as the only way to take him down is truly pathetic.

Sessions (and his recusal) is the only thing standing between Trump and escaping accountability. 

What should happen at the end of the investigation? Should the results be locked away in a drawer never to be seen or should congress get to see the findings? The Special Counsel (Mueller) reports his findings to the AG (Sessions) and **the AG has sole authority to determine if we ever see the results of the investigation**. Except Sessions has recused himself and is so far respecting that recusal so the deputy AG (Rosenstein) is in charge of the investigation. If Rosenstein we__e fired, [we__ have mass protests on our hands](https://www.marchfortruth.info/mueller-rapid-response/). 

But if Sessions is replaced with someone without a recusal, as the new AG, it would have the same effect as Rosenstein being fired.

&gt;As the reason for all this is truly brilliant scheme that solves a very multi-faceted problem. First and foremost it gains votes, his entire platform is about America first and this is a great way to throw shade on that. Second, not one peep ever again about the massive amounts of corruption that was revealed form the leaks. Third, they were able to use these findings as more ammo to start the special counsel that is going to carry on the charade all the way up until midterms. Fourth, they are able to focus in on the investigation in the media and not actually policy changes.

&gt;And thats just the domestic and political benefits the left can get from this. I dont really want to get into to much about how this is shaping the current situation in the middle east because it will really out myself for the conspiracy theorist I am.

&gt;I dont think Don Jr will accept any deal ever regardless of what anyone puts in-front of him. To be frank about it, I dont like the guy. I think hes a moron and acts like a idiot on a day to day basis. He is the quintessential trust fund douche bag and would be shit posting on twitter until the day the feds kick in his door if he actually did commit a crime.

&gt;Totally wrong. Crowdstrike is an official FBI contractor, and the DNC and FBI mutually agreed to using them.

&gt;Crowd strike had a previous contract worth 150k from july 2015-16. Its for some work unrelated to this investigation. The FBI repeatedly asked for access to the server to investigate and were rebuffed. We know this from Comey's own testimony. Stop saying Official FBI contractor like it means anything important, they dont answer to the public they answer to the investors as they are a private company hired by the DNC.

&gt;You know all this. You are just muddying the waters because you dont have a good reason for them not to turn it over. This raises monumental concern because we are shaping geopolitical policy based on a private companies word. We have a FBI for a reason, the minute they refused to let them investigate is the minute I dont give a fuck what they find. There is only one real reason to take these actions, to find what they want not what actually happened.

&gt;So my turn for a question. How would you feel if Trump hired a Private company to investigate his Russian connections and they found """"nothing"""". Would you expect people to accept those findings?

&gt;That is according to crowd strike. The 17 IC all saying Russia is a blatant repeated lie. The report put out was intentionally misleading using weasel language. They said """"we believe"""" and are """"consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts"""". So in other non weasel word, we dont fucking know.

&gt;Here is what we DO know.

&gt;The DNC refused to turn over the servers to the FBI.

&gt;They altered the DATA before copying it THEN turned it over.

&gt;The person leaking the emails, who you guys call a """"Russian agent"""" has never been wrong or had to retract anything has said it was leaked. (I know this doesnt mean fuck all to you)

&gt;Trump wanted to work WITH Russia since before this """"hack"""", and so did the voters. We can see the EUs direction and dont like it.

&gt;Manafort, like everyone is Washington has a long list of contacts. You need to make a case other then """"he had contact"""". That doesnt mean fuck all. He doesnt even have the capacity to enact or get rid of sanctions and he got fucking canned.

mods are in a difficult position. Reddit as a whole tries very hard to
maintain its business-friendly moderate liberal veneer, and they'll
let subreddits fall through the cracks only as long as they aren't
very big or don't make too much noise. 


I can almost guarantee that a subreddit of this size has at least one
neoliberal """"anti-hate speech"""" mod to make sure that no one says
anything too out of line. This happens as a subreddit grows in
size/influence, like r/bestof, various gaming subs around the time of
gamergate, various news-related subs and even smaller politics and
philosophy subs; sometimes they will even install an admin as a
mod against the wishes of subreddit members, or refuse to remove
an admin mod, since admins have extra moderation tools that can
silence critics and the other mods.

182,"Your theory hinges on one critical flaw you consistently over look. Russia did not hack the DNC, it was leaked by a insider. You operate like that has been proven but everything points to the opposite. All the bullshit about the 17 agencies is completely laughable. The amount of influence being asserted to twist these heads to issue statements based on bullshit is astounding really. We can start at the very beginning with the initial lie by james clapper that gets toted around as its some kind of proof.

&gt;""""The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow__he Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.""""

This was a deliberate deceptive message. It implied that the all 16 intelligence agencies agreed with the premise and __vidence of Russian meddling. Yet not a single bit of proof was offered. More telling was the absence of any written document issued from the Office of the DNI that detailed the supposed intel backing up this judgment. 

Notice the weasel language in this release:
&gt;The USIC is **confident**
&gt;We **believe** . . .

If there was actual evidence/intelligence, such as an intercepted conversation between Vladimir Putin and a subordinate ordering them to hack the DNC or even a human source report claiming such an activity, then it would have and should have been referenced in the Clapper/Johnson document. It was not because such intel did not exist.

Then Hillary Clinton helped perpetuate this myth during the late October debate with Donald Trump, when she declared as fact that:
&gt;""""We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,"""" Clinton said. """"I find that deeply disturbing._

What is shocking is that there was so little pushback to this nonsense. Hardly anyone asked why would the DEA, Coast Guard, the Marines or DOE have any technical expertise to make a judgment about Russian hacking of U.S. election systems.  And no one of any importance asked the obvious__here was the written memo or National Intelligence Estimate laying out what the IC supposedly knew and believed? There was **nothing**.


 The document produced in January 2017 was not a genuine work reflecting the views of the __ntelligence Community._ It only represented the supposed thinking (and I use that term generously) of CIA, NSA and FBI analysts. In other words, only three of 16 agencies cleared on the document that presented four conclusions:

&gt;Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow__ longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.

&gt;We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. 
 
&gt;We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes.

Sounds pretty ominous, but the language used tells a different story. The conclusions are based on assumptions and judgments. There was nor is any actual evidence from intelligence sources showing that Vladimir Putin ordered up anything or that his government preferred Trump over Clinton.


So in conclusion the Intelligence Community was used as a tool to misinform the public and persuade them that Russia was guilty of something they did not do. That lie remains unchallenged. Its not a conspiracy theory it is right fucking there in front of us, its a fact. 

**you** **are** **the** **one** **peddling** **conspiracy** **theories** **I** **am** **following** **facts**

249,"Im just going to copy paste my comment on them from last week. All sourced and their own methodology section is where a lot of the information comes from.


But lets get down to the brass tax here about the Russian bots being reported here. They are basing their story on a times [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/technology/russian-bots-school-shooting.html) , they are doing no investigating of their own so were just going to fall back to the times article to see where the source of this information is coming from. The times article is using information fed to them by the """"Alliance for securing democracy"""" and their """"Hamilton 68 dashboard"""". Here is a link to their own site that explains their [methodology section](http://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/blog/2017/08/02/hamilton-68-new-tool-track-russian-disinformation-twitter) on where they explain how they determine what is being pushed by Russian bots. There entire dashboard is based around 600 accounts they deemed Russian propaganda accounts. How did they do that you ask? Lets have a look.

&gt;We identified these accounts through three different methods. First, we tracked disinformation campaigns that synchronized with overt Russian propaganda outlets like Sputnik and RT (Russia Today). We analyzed the social networks of users who were promoting this disinformation to identify which users were centrally involved, and to remove users who tweeted disinformation casually, after encountering it online.

&gt;Second, we identified a group of users online that openly professed to be pro-Russian and tweeted primarily in support of Russian government policies and themes. We analyzed followers of these accounts to identify a large and interconnected social network that tweeted the same themes and content.

&gt;Third, we identified accounts that appear to use automation to boost the signal of other accounts linked to Russian influence operations. We assessed this group by looking at accounts that had disproportionately large numbers of interactions with other accounts (including sending and receiving retweets) along with a very high number of tweets per day. These accounts may be bots, meaning a piece of computer code that tweets automatically based on pre-determined rules, or they may be cyborgs, meaning that some of their activity is automated, which is then manually supplemented by a human user.

The entire methodology is critically flawed and hinges solely on what they deem """"Russian talking points"""". So now the question would be who is """"they"""" a what are they using to determine are """"Russian talking points"""". So now let explore that avenue shall we?

Lets start with the [source](https://theintercept.com/2017/07/17/with-new-d-c-policy-group-dems-continue-to-rehabilitate-and-unify-with-bush-era-neocons/) I am using for this. The organization is being run by two prominent figures who are Laura Rosenberger, and Jamie fly. Laura served as a foreign policy adviser for Hillary Clinton__ 2016 presidential campaign and chief of staff to two Obama national security officials. And Jamie whos one of the most notorious neocons in Washington famous for his criticizing of Obama for not using MORE military action in Iran. This is a man who, to put it bluntly, gets paid on the back of dead soldiers and war.

Now lets move on  to the board of directors.

* Jake Sullivan - national security adviser to Joe Biden and the Clinton campaign

* Mike Morrell - Obama__ acting CIA director

* Mike McFaul - Obama__ ambassador to Russia

* Mike Chertoff - Bush__ homeland security secretary

* Mike Rogers - the far-right, supremely hawkish former congressman who now hosts a right-wing radio show

* Bill Kristol - you know who he is. 
 

&gt;In sum _ just as was true of the first Cold War, when neocons made their home among the Cold Warriors of the Democratic Party _ on the key foreign policy controversies, there is now little to no daylight between leading Democratic Party foreign policy gurus and the Bush-era neocons who had wallowed in disgrace following the debacle of Iraq and the broader abuses of the war on terror. That__ why they are able so comfortably to unify this way in support of common foreign policy objectives and beliefs.

So we have a all star team of neocons and democrats who worked along side Clinton and Obama. These people profit off of instability and war and are about the FARTHEST thing you can get from a impartial point of view of this situation. Their methodology uses no real proof so they can sculpt and mold what the """"Russians"""" are attacking.

Mueller III, has subpoenaed the Trump Organization to turn over documents, including some related to Russia, according to two people briefed on the matter. **The order is the first known time that the special counsel demanded documents directly related to President Trump__ businesses, bringing the investigation closer to the president.**
&gt; 
&gt; The breadth of the subpoena was not clear, nor was it clear why Mr. Mueller issued it instead of simply asking for the documents from the company, an umbrella organization that oversees Mr. Trump__ business ventures. **In the subpoena, delivered in recent weeks, Mr. Mueller ordered the Trump Organization to hand over all documents related to Russia and other topics he is investigating**, the people said.
&gt; 
&gt; **The subpoena is the latest indication that the investigation, which Mr. Trump__ lawyers once regularly assured him would be completed by now, will drag on for at least several more months. Word of the subpoena comes as Mr. Mueller appears to be broadening his investigation to examine the role foreign money may have played in funding Mr. Trump__ political activities. In recent weeks, Mr. Mueller__ investigators have questioned witnesses, including an adviser to the United Arab Emirates, about the flow of Emirati money into the United States.**
&gt; 
&gt; Neither White House officials nor Alan S. Futerfas, a lawyer representing the Trump Organization, immediately responded to requests for comment. The Trump Organization has typically complied with requests from congressional investigators for documents for their own inquiries into Russian election interference, and there was no indication the company planned to fight Mr. Mueller about it.
&gt; 
&gt; The Trump Organization has said that it never had real estate holdings in Russia, but witnesses recently interviewed by Mr. Mueller have been asked about a possible real estate deal in Moscow. In 2015, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump__ emailed Mr. Trump__ lawyer, Michael Cohen, at his Trump Organization account claiming he had ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and said that building a Trump Tower in Moscow would help Mr. Trump__ presidential campaign.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Mueller could run afoul of a line the president has warned him not to cross. Though it is not clear how much of the subpoena is related to Mr. Trump__ business beyond ties to Russia, Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in July that the special counsel would be crossing a __ed line_ if he looked into his family__ finances beyond any relationship with Russia. The president declined to say how he would respond if he concluded that the special counsel had crossed that line.
&gt; 
&gt; A month before Mr. Trump spoke of his red line, the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to quit after Mr. Trump asked him to have Mr. Mueller fired because the president believed he had conflict-of-interest issues that precluded him from running the special counsel investigation.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Mueller was appointed in May to investigate whether Mr. Trump__ campaign colluded with the Russians to influence the 2016 presidential election and any other matters that may arise from the inquiry. He is also examining whether the president has tried to obstruct the investigation.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Trump__ lawyers are in negotiations with Mr. Mueller__ office about whether and how to allow his investigators to interview the president. Mr. Mueller__ office has shared topics it wants to discuss with the president, according to two people familiar with the talks. The lawyers have advised Mr. Trump to refuse an interview but the president wants to do it, as he believes he has done nothing wrong and can easily answer investigators_ questions.
&gt; 
&gt; At the same time, Mr. Trump is considering whether to bring on a new lawyer to help represent him in the special counsel__ investigation. Last week, Mr. Trump spoke with Emmet Flood, a longtime Washington lawyer who represented former President Bill Clinton during the impeachment process, about coming into the White House to deal with the inquiry.",,HaLoGuY007,37,t3_84offn,dvr30fx,t3_84offn,t5_3jjnn,1521137289,0.10805,0.738558,0.053074,0.011341,0.099258,0,0.192005,0.511019,0.138471,0.16737,0.456062,0.541621,0.23754409,Error!

Last December, amid the jumbled Republican presidential nomination scrum, Donald Trump carved out a half an hour for a live video interview with a volcanic Austin radio and web-streaming host who broadcasts from a semi-secret location dubbed __he Central Texas Command Center and the Heart of the Resistance._

Alex Jones, America__ foremost purveyor of outlandish conspiracy theories, was in a buoyant mood that day. He__ had Matt Drudge, the influential conservative news aggregator, on recently. But this was much bigger.

Trump wasted no time signaling that his mind-set aligned with the host__. Trump said he wouldn__ apologize for asserting that large numbers of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated the collapse of the twin towers in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a claim that fact-checkers have repeatedly refuted.

__eople like you and I can__ do that so easily,_ the New York developer, speaking from his office in Trump Tower, said. He would later call Jones __ nice guy._

The December interview would reverberate into the general election as Hillary Clinton tried to use it to paint Trump as an irresponsible crackpot associating with an irresponsible crackpot. It also pushed Jones, who operates the websites Infowars.com and Prisonplanet.com, from the realm of niche showman into the mainstream national dialogue. The man who said that the Newtown, Conn., school shooting was a __oax_ involving child actors and claimed that elements of the U.S. government were responsible for bombing the Oklahoma City federal building and for the 9/11 attacks had been granted an enormous new audience.

__ think Alex Jones may be the single most important voice in the alternative conservative media,_ says Roger Stone, the Nixon-era political trickster who orchestrated Trump__ appearance on the show.

On Monday, Trump seemed to confirm Jones__ status. Jones says Trump called to promise he would return to the program to thank the Infowars audience, an extraordinary gesture for an incoming president whose schedule is packed with calls from world leaders and the enormous task of overseeing the transition. The president-elect__ team hasn__ confirmed that the conversation took place.

These were your words;

&gt;The Russian bot obsession has passed from funny and desperate to worrying. Eventually they will be able to shut down all opposing view points by saying two simple words.

The Russian disinformation campaign continues while the current administration refuses to act upon a real threat, President Trump has failed to give instructions to the NSA to disrupt Russian election meddling.^[[1]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/27/trump-russia-meddling-mike-rogers) They have a long history of promoting disinformation campaigns in an attempt to destabilize the West and America, there is historical precedence.^[[2]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/us/politics/russian-disinformation-aids-fake-news.html) The parallels between what is happening now and what occurred in Ukraine in 2014 are uncanny in nature and should worry every sane American and Westerner.^[[3]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/inside-a-russian-disinformation-campaign-in-ukraine-in-2014/2017/12/25/f55b0408-e71d-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html?utm_term=.f20b9d1d4710)

This was an extremely sophisticated operation, I recommend reading the indictment as it is only 37 pages long, below I have included a few excerpts.^[[4]](https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download) They bought political ads on social media in the names of US persons. All of this was funded through Russian fronts, including a catering company run by a Russian national known as """"Putin's chef"""".

Russian operatives used stolen US identities, travelled across 9 states collecting intelligence, discussed escape routes if they were caught inside the country, bought equipment including burner phones/SIM cards. This operation included hundreds of employees conducting information warfare during the election, it was funded with millions of dollars from the Kremlin. 


&gt;**Object of the Conspiracy;**

&gt; 28.. The conspiracy had as its object impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful government functions of the United States by dishonest means in order to enable the Defendants to interfere with US political and electoral processes, including the 2016 US presidential election.  

&gt;**Manner and Means of the Conspiracy:**

&gt; 29.. Starting at least in or around 2014, Defendants and their co-conspirators began to track and study groups on US social media sites dedicated to US politics and social issues. In order to gauge the performance of various groups on social media sites, the ORGANIZATION tracked certain metrics like the group's size, the frequency of content places by the group, and the level of audience engagement with that content, such as the average number of comments or responses to  a post. 



&gt;a. KRYLOVA and BOGACHEVA, together with other defendants and co-conspirators, planned travel itineraries, purchases equipment (such as cameras, SIM cards, and drop phones), and discussed security measures (including """"evacuation scenarios"""") for Defendants who traveled to the United States. 


&gt;**Use of US Social Media Platforms**

&gt;32.. Defendants and their co-conspirators, through fraud and deceit, created hundres of social media accounts and used them to develop certain fictitious US personas into """"leader[s] of public opinion"""" in the United States. 

&gt;**Use of US Computer Infrastructure**

&gt;39.. To hide their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, Defendants and their co-conspirators - particularly POLOZOV and the ORGANIZATION's IT department - purchases space on computer servers located inside the United States in order to set up virtual private networks (""""VPNs""""). Defendants and their co-conspirators connected from Russia to the US based infrastructure by way of these VPNs and conducted activity inside the United Sates - including accessing online social media accounts, opening new accounts, and communicated with real US persons - while masking the Russian origin and control of the activity. 

&gt;40.. Defendants and their co-conspirators also registered and controlled hundreds of web-based email accounts hosted by US email providers under false names so as to appear to be US persons and groups. From these accounts, Defendants and their co-conspirators registered or linked to online social media accounts in order to monitor them; posed as US persons when requesting assistance from real US persons; contacted media outlets in order to promote activities inside the United States; and conducted other operations, such as those set forth below. 

&gt;**Use of Stolen US Identities**

&gt;41.. In or around 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators also uses, possessed, and transferred, without lawful authority, the social security numbers and dates of birth of real US persons without those persons' knowledge or consent. Using these means of identification, Defendants and their co-conspirators opened accounts at PayPal, a digital payment service provider; created false means of identification, including fake driver's licenses; and posted on ORGANIZATION - controlled social media accounts using the identities of these US victims. 

&gt;**Actions Targeting the 2016 US Presidential Election**

&gt;42.. By approximately May 2014, Defendants and their co-conspirators discussed efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. Defendants and their co-conspirators began to monitor US social media accounts and other sources of information about the 2016 US presidential election. 

&gt;43.. By 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used their fictitious online personas to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election. They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump. 

&gt;45.. Defendants and their co-conspirators also used false US personas to communicate with unwitting members, volunteers, and supporters of the Trump Campaign involved in local community outreach, as well as grassroots groups that supported then-candidate Trump. These individuals and entities at times distributed the ORGANIZATION's materials through their own accounts via retweets, reposts, and similar means. Defendants and their co-conspirators then monitored the propagation of content through such participants. 

&gt;46.. In or around the latter half of 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, through their ORGANIZATION-controlled personas, began to encourage US minority groups not to vote in the 2016 US presidential election or to vote for a third-party US presidential candidate. 

&gt;47.. Starting in or around the summer of 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators also began to promote allegations of voter fraud by the Democratic Party through their fictitious US personas and groups on social media. Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased advertisements on Facebook to further promote the allegations. 

&gt;**Political Advertisements**

&gt;48.. From at least April 2016 through November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, while concealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation through false personas, began to produce, purchase, and post advertisements on US social media and other online sites expressly advocating for the election of then-candidate Trump or expressly opposing Clinton. Defendants and their co-conspirators did not report their expenditures to the Federal Election Commission, or register as foreign agents with the US Department of Justice.

**Cadre** (a company Jared Kushner co-founded and left off his security clearance paperwork) is also in Peter Thiel__ portfolio. ^[[1]](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/donald-trump-peter-thiel-top-intelligence-advisory-post) Thiel, who was part of the Trump transition team, gained a role following his donation of more than a million dollars to Trump__ campaign within days of the Billy Bush tape release. ^[[2]](https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/11/13602026/peter-thiel-trump-transition-team-facebook)  
Bannon said of Thiel: 

&gt;__ cannot overstate his impact on the transition,_ Bannon began, describing Thiel as a hidden hand in shaping Team Trump. __ou will see in the near term that Peter will be taking on new responsibilities, like intelligence._ While Trump and his communications squad may rail about Washington__ permanent bureaucracy, especially those in national-security positions, Bannon talked about having been in the trenches alongside Thiel as part of an offensive against the so-called Deep State__[[1]](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/donald-trump-peter-thiel-top-intelligence-advisory-post)  Although he doesn__ have an official post, Peter Thiel__ company Palantir was just awarded a $876 million U.S. Army contract. ^[[3]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-09/peter-thiel-s-palantir-wins-876-million-u-s-army-contract) 

Bannon wasn__ the only Breitbart employee interested in Thiel. He also initially had a connection to Milo Yiannopoulos.
&gt;Thiel invited the Breitbart tech editor for dinner at his Hollywood Hills home in June, a dinner Yiannopoulos boasted of the same night to Bannon: 

__ou two should meet. _ An obvious candidate for movie financing if we got external. _ He has f#$%#d (Gawker Media founder Nick) Denton &amp; Gawker so many ways it brought a tear to my eye._ 

They made plans to meet during the July Republican National Convention. 

&gt;But much of Yiannopoulos__ knowledge of Thiel seemed to come secondhand from other right-wing activists, as well as Curtis Yarvin, the blogger who advocates the return of feudalism.  In an email exchange shortly after the election, Yarvin told Yiannopoulos that he had been __oaching Thiel._  __eter needs guidance on politics for sure,_ Yiannopoulos responded. 
__ess than you might think!_ Yarvin wrote back.

And there was that __illains and Heroes_ costume party/fundraiser that everyone all seemed to be at: 

__ Mr. Thiel dressed as Hulk Hogan for the __illains and Heroes_ annual costume party last month, hosted on Long Island by the Mercer Family, who were big trump donors.  He shows me a picture on his phone of him posing with **Erik Prince**, who founded Blackwater, and Mr. Trump - who had no costume_ ^[[5]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/fashion/peter-thiel-donald-trump-silicon-valley-technology-gawker.html)

Thiel dressed as Hogan because he secretly funded Hogan__ lawsuit against Gawker that was settled for $31 million. ^[[6]](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/02/hogan-thiel-gawker-trial/554132/)  Thiel is on Facebook__ board and __uckerberg has continually defended Thiel__ presence on Facebook__ governing body as vital to the company, a balancing presence to stop the site from sliding too far in any one political direction._ ^[[7]](https://nymag.com/selectall/2018/01/is-peter-thiel-playing-mark-zuckerberg.html) Thiel helped lead a meeting to calm down conservatives that believed they were being __ensored_ including: Glenn Beck, Tucker Carlson, Dana Perino, and leaders from the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute. ^[[7]](https://nymag.com/selectall/2018/01/is-peter-thiel-playing-mark-zuckerberg.html).

Palantir is a controversial data analytics firm co-founded by billionaire investor Peter Thiel.

Crowd strike had a previous contract worth 150k from july 2015-16. Its for some work unrelated to this investigation. The FBI repeatedly asked for access to the server to investigate and were rebuffed. We know this from Comey's own testimony.

You know all this. You are just muddying the waters because you dont have a good reason for them not to turn it over. This raises monumental concern because we are shaping geopolitical policy based on a private companies word.

That should hold some weight as you guys seemed to have placed him on a highly undeserved pedestal.

Second - the DNI video says literally nothing about this.  It's a threat without substance.  """"If you did this, you're in trouble.""""  In the immortal words of every fifth grader ever - duh.

Third - as to Turley's opinion piece,

So - in response:

1) [The recused Sessions violated his recusal to perform this firing](https://www.justsecurity.org/54037/sessions-firing-mccabe-violated-promise-recuse/) and [he has skin in the game to discredit mccabe](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/us/politics/jeff-sessions-special-counsel-russia.html).

2) [Trump made clear via tweet that the reasons weren't what Turley alleges.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/975163071361683456)  The reason was the witch hunt.  This is like firing someone for any other pretext - you can fire someone because they wear brightly colored shoes, but not because they're black.  The President's tweets absolutely say that it was the leaks but it ties it back to the Comey firing which, surprise surprise, puts the lie to your position. [ Trump admitted on TV that he fired Comey over the Russia thing](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/11/donald-trump-james-comey-firing-russia-investigation).  Oops.  He tied the firing of McCabe to the firing of Comey and by extension, the Russia thing.  Double oops.  So, not so much for Very Legitimate Reasons, more like a potentially defensible pretext.

3) [Trump's LAWYER made clear the same thing](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/17/politics/john-dowd-mueller-russia-investigation/index.html).  Ditto on defensible pretext.

4) Meanwhile, the """"very legitimate reasons"""" don't actually mean [what you think they mean, according to former FBI agent Asha Rangappa](https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/975169077110099969).  

Now, if you're an FBI agent (and if so, proof to the mods would be cool) then I'll trust you know what you're talking about.  If not? I'm not compelled by a partisan oped.

5) Meanwhile - as with the """"fire for their shoes but not their skin color"""" pretext issue - the evidence is weighted pretty heavily in favor of his having been fired for political reasons - because it must be read in conjunction with the timing - two days before his retirement, and [88 days after Trump's tweet setting a 90 day countdown timer](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/944666448185692166?lang=en) on McCabe running down the clock - furthering evidence that the firing was political, and not based on the """"very legitimate reasons"""" which are not yet known to the public.

**EDIT: thanks for the downvotes guess I'm full of shit and so are the researchers that Congress consulted on this very issue...**

(you people are fucking ignorant)

&gt; When assessing the potential vulnerability of U.S. military forces and civilian critical 
infrastructures to EMP, it is necessary to be mindful of the complex interdependencies of these 
highly-networked systems, because EMP upset and damage of a very small fraction of the total 
system can cause total system failure.26
Real world failures of electric grids from various causes indicate that a nuclear EMP attack 
would have catastrophic consequences. Significant and highly disruptive blackouts have been 
caused by single-point failures cascading into system-wide failures, originating from damage 
comprising far less than 1 percent of the total system.

From their own methodology section.


&gt;We tracked disinformation campaigns that synchronized with overt Russian propaganda outlets like Sputnik and RT (Russia Today). We analyzed the social networks of users who were promoting this disinformation to identify which users were centrally involved, and to remove users who tweeted disinformation casually, after encountering it online.

&gt;We identified a group of users online who openly professed to be pro-Russian and tweeted primarily in support of Russian government policies and themes. We analyzed followers of these accounts to identify a large and interconnected social network that tweeted the same themes and content.

&gt;Not all content in this network is __reated_ by Russia. A significant amount__robably a majority__f content is created by third parties and then amplified by the network because it is relevant to Russian messaging themes.

&gt;Because of the two points above, we emphasize it is NOT CORRECT to describe sites linked by this network as Russian propaganda sites. We are not claiming that content producers linked by this network are Russian propaganda sites. Rather, content linked by this network is RELEVANT to Russian messaging themes.

&gt; Because it is illegal for foreign nationals to spend money in U.S. campaigns, obscuring funds coming from, say, an agent of the Russian government _ by funneling them through an organization like the NRA _ would be akin to money laundering.

&gt; Growing evidence is showing that money from hidden sources could be influencing current political leaders via two avenues: through the obscured personal finances of the president, and other public officials; and through secret contributions to political organizations.

&gt; It has been widely reported that a vast amount of Russian money is tied up in President Donald Trump's assets and business interests _ interests which Trump, breaking with longstanding precedent, refused to divest or put into a blind trust upon assuming office. Recent reports have shown that money continues to move into Trump-branded properties from obscured sources like anonymous LLCs and shell companies.

&gt; One such report found that since Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, the fraction of anonymous purchases of his properties through shell companies has """"skyrocketed"""" from 4 to 70 percent. The public can only guess at the source of these funds, whether they be foreign governments or wealthy domestic interests__nd to what extent unknown sums pouring into other Trump businesses are being used to curry favor with the president.

&gt; Moreover, in the case of the NRA, the FBI is now investigating whether illicit funds were spent in support of Trump's political campaign. We have long warned that our broken system of campaign finance disclosure creates opportunities for foreign governments to illegally influence American elections, undetected.

&gt; The NRA is among the largest """"dark money"""" organizations, reporting the greatest amount of campaign spending without revealing the source of the funds _ over $35 million in the 2016 election cycle alone. Still, this amount was just a fraction of the over $175 million in reported campaign-related spending that came from unknown sources.

&gt; As these examples demonstrate, the Russia investigation is not just relevant to allegations of collusion, or even just to Russia. It is revealing a fundamental vulnerability in our political system _ one that is being exploited by Russia, but that is also being exploited by others, foreign and domestic, who want to see American government serve their interests instead of the interests of the American public.",,HaLoGuY007,7,t1_duhsecz,duhuiau,t3_7yn41c,t5_3jjnn,1519057132,0.608855,0.099802,0.100781,0.20576,0.678392,-0.532354,0.564483,0.09022,0.446632,0.501781,0.206646,-0.399339,0.61209786,0.34769145

Nice try, but Steele went to the FBI after Fusion stopped paying (meaning it was no longer oppo research). Initially, the conservative Washington Examiner funded it. Then, the Clinton campaign funded it. After that, the FBI funded it. Finally, Steele did it for free. Why did so many people fund it, and why did Steele eventually do it for free? **Because what he found was fucking scary.**

BTW, the FBI stopped paying because they didn't want to get accused of playing politics. In doing so, they played politics, and that's when Steele started freaking out. (It's all in Luke Harding's *Collusion* book.)

&gt;So you have the DNC paying for this dossier, using the dossier to obtain warrants, then using that information for political gain. So the DNC colluded with not one, two, but 3 foreign governments to write this piece of piss fan fiction then used their contacts in the FBI to abuse it.

&gt;Carter Page was under investigation for being a Russian Agent since 2013. Long before Trump even thought of being president

To renew a FISA warrant you need to present a case, his previous FISA warrants held ZERO weight when it comes time for renewal that is why they needed to fabricate new evidence.

&gt;The quote in the memo about Steele not wanting Trump to be president lacks context.

We have a full quote that really doesnt need context at all. Its very straight forward and completely shits on the line you people tote of """"prestigious British spy just trying to do good"""" Just another jaded money hungry idiot. 

&gt;During Steele's investigation he found evidence that Trump businesses and Jared Kushner businesses showed signs that money laundering was occurring. There activities, along with known Russian agent contacts led him to believe crimes were being actively committed. He took those concerns to the FBI as a private citizen and not acting on behalf of or on orders from Fusion GPS.

Steele was suspended as a FBI source. The exact reasons are unknown but most seem to think its his leaking to the press. Thats when fusion GPS picked him up and set up a back channel to the FBI so they can continue using this discredited information as evidence for a FISA application. They set up this back channel to they can mask the source of the information that they are giving to the courts, because if known they would not be able to obtain the warrant. They then had steele leak the contents of his dossier to YAHOO news had them run a story then used that very same story to corroborate and lend credibility to the dossier. 



Easy provable case of fabricating evidence in a attempt to weaponize the IC to do your opposition research for you so you have a better chance at removing the president. Thankfully your rats have no power anymore and noone is protecting them except for the a couple stragglers that will be outed soon enough. Get fucked.

Carter Page was under investigation for being a Russian Agent since 2013.  Long before Trump even thought of being president

The quote in the memo about Steele not wanting Trump to be president lacks context.  The context is provided in the Glenn Simpson testimony.  During Steele's investigation he found evidence that Trump businesses and Jared Kushner businesses showed signs that money laundering was occurring.  These activities, along with known Russian agent contacts led him to believe crimes were being actively committed.  He took those concerns to the FBI as a private citizen and not acting on behalf of or on orders from Fusion GPS.  When Steele saw these crimes, his opinion was that we should not have a criminal elected president under any circumstances.  No brainer there.

Trey Gowdy says this does not stop the investigation and he has full faith in McCabe, Mueller and Rosenstein

Trump spokespeople claim Carter Page was not on Team Trump and Trump himself denies even knowing the guy.  So either he had nothing to do with Trump and therefore has no bearing on TrumpRussia, or he was actually a foreign policy advisor for Trump.  In which case your Dear Leader is lying.

Would they have been able to obtain any number of indictments if it wasnt for the FISA warrants? Are any of these indictments in relation to the collusion charge?

The only thing you have to show that this investigation is going anywhere are these indictments. The only way you got any of these indictments was fabricating evidence so you can have full surveillance on them and catch them in a simple lie. If the charges on Flynn were directly tied to collusion with Russia and can be proven then the case should continue but thats not what happened. In fact they immediately recused the judge that approved the warrants and accepted Flynn's plea. And now they are delaying that even more in the light of the memo.

I am following the very reasonable line of thinking, if they had to pay someone to write this and then corroborate it with a yahoo article that means they most likely had no other credible information. Unless you have some bombshell information the line of """"they had more evidence"""" is the baseless misleading claim. 

But I see what you are doing, I have to follow provable evidence while the mods and their users can go bat shit crazy with baseless accusations. I cannot be mean to people despite the constant labels and name callings. 

Despite you trying your best to make sure the people subscribed to this sub only get the misleading information you feed them ill make sure they get the other side. Remember what we have now, and what we have proven, and what you haven't even corroborated in the least. 

Your only indictments are from warrants based on lies and fairy tales.

There is no one claiming the FBI fabricated evidence. The only claim is that the FBI didn't mention evidence when, supposedly, they should have. Turns out, they did mention the dossier information was paid for by political entities, just not with specificity. 

Did they do that as a lie of omission? You'll say yes...

Did they do it because it wasn't fucking relevant to rooting out a russian spy? Perhaps...

Do we not have all the answers right now because we have no idea what the norms and rules are for submitting a FISA warrant application and because we don't actually have the full applications? I'll say yes... 

You need to calm down, dude. You're just making things up (""""fabricating evidence"""") to support your narrative.

Those text messages are not """"politically charged"""" - they're day to day ops between colleagues who happen to be having an affair.  Writing the memos, who do we talk to, can I go in his office now that his secretary has gone etc.

This does not create a fruit-of-the-poison-tree evidentiary problem - the dubious fact that investigators had bias in their investigation - which these texts don't actually show - wouldn't change the underlying facts unless they either:

1) Created evidence - there is no such allegation; 

2) Withheld evidence - there is no such allegation; or

3) Had chain of custody issues with the evidence collected in their investigation - there is no such allegation.

As such, the fact that think that Trump is a terrible person (a position which more than half of the country agrees with and is actually NOT in evidence here) may taint the political process and the congressional investigations, but does so no more than Devin Nunes' dishonest """"memo"""" or Gowdy's backflips.  The political process is entirely beside the point.  Meanwhile, as soon as this information surfaced, Mueller fired them like the straight shooter he is.  From an attorney's standpoint, not only does that undercut the """"vast left-wing conspiracy"""" but it also demonstrates once again that Mueller's behavior is beyond reproach.

The facts remain the facts and the evidence remains the evidence.  It may make you sad and frustrated, but that doesn't change the evidentiary standard and the behavior of the investigators really doesn't impact anything unless any of the three above listed items are proven true.  Even then, it would only taint those pieces of evidence which were touched by (or manufactured by) the two of them.  
The """"loaded for bear"""" comment is a deeply political one - don't want to piss off the potential new boss.  There aren't similar texts about investigating Trump because of the McConnel-Price-Giuliani-NYPD conspiracy which suppressed that end of the investigation.

&gt;INBOX: ... if Laufman makes himself one of the two DoJ, do I send the two case agents or insert myself. Andy told Bill send the best two. And what """"best"""" means isn't clear to me in this context.

&gt;OUTBOX: Best means best. It's not a trick.

&gt;INBOX: We talked about it, but """"best"""" was not in terms of agents (though that's what I wrote), it's about what the best outcome is.

Very clearly they want the """"best"""" agents in terms of a favorable outcome for Clinton. They write back and forth how to fill the team in a way that will please Clinton and give her the best outcome. Its clear as day they even made the specification there so it wouldn't get confused with """"best"""" agents in terms of doing good investigative work. 


&gt;The Trump campaign 2016 investigation was manipulated

Using opposition research to push a investigation on the person you are running against is manipulation. Was there A FISA warrant before the dossier hit the desk? Nope. They created the evidence needed used the obvious connection in the IC and got what they needed. 

&gt;The Special Counsel investigation was manipulated

Was Strzok on it? Was the Dossier needed to initiate the counsel? 

&gt;That Strzok and Page have bias against Trump
&gt;That Strzok's and Page's bias against Trump affected their job performance in any way.

In previously released text messages they have Strzok """"disappointed"""" he couldn't find collusion yet. Why would a unbiased person be disappointed the President ISNT colluding with a foreign nation? Would this disappointment motivate fabrication? 


&gt;That Strzok's and Page's job performance affected the investigations of Clinton or Trump in any way.

They literally hand pick agents that would give Hillary the """"best outcome"""" out of the notion she will be president and want to please her. It says it right fucking there in the texts. 


So you have FBI hand picking agents to get HIllary off. Agents taking opposition research to get warrants on the party they are working for opposition. You have them stocking the investigation that is based off of this oppo funded research with the very same people working for Clinton. This is 100% rigged and the more that comes out the more that is confirmed.

It's fair to say the Page and Strzok didn't like Trump.

Neither of those points have been proven. 

This is what I'm talking about when I say you have to show *causality*. It's not enough to place two facts next to each other and assume a connection. You have to demonstrate the connection.

Sure, they're intertwined, but you'll have to provide evidence that those connections are affecting results. Again... more shit to prove for you. If you want to prove the two agents had biased opinions, during the campaign, I think that's proven. If you want to prove their biased opinions affected their work, you need to provide more evidence.

Yes, it is clear. They were referring to the Trump investigation, not the Trump candidacy. You can twist words all you want, but the explanation is clear: that there was a discussion whether to devote resources to investigating Trump, but they decided not to because they didn't believe he'd win. Strzok/Page disagreed with that """"path"""". Even more reason to believe their personal opinions didn't influence the """"path"""" the FBI took in it's investigation.

You have a fundamental problem understanding the implications of someone who is working such a important case fucking and discussing the case with someone from different departments. That not only shows a bias but a inability to act proper when faced with such a important task. It shows the ability to lie, distort, and extreme bitterness stemming from being so wrong. You put a anti-trumper who is cheating on his wife with a FBI agent while discussing highly confidential information at a rate of SIXTY THOUSAND text messages on a impartial special counsel.

 So did the people forming the counsel not know of his dealings? Exactly how can a man send 60 thousand texts to a mistress without notice? How does the FBI exactly go about """"losing them""""? All just a happy coincidence? The woman who could lose everything has the department she works for lose ALL the evidence on her and you just write that up as chance?

OK. 

&gt; sure they discussed a insurance plan if trump won

That's not what happened. I will not cede this point. This is not what happened. Their """"insurance plan"""" was to *not to put the Trump investigation on the back burner* despite them thinking he was going to lose. There is zero evidence they were trying to affect the outcome of the election. 

&gt; sure part of the counsel is fucking a senior FBI official and discuss highly charged political matters, 

So? Again, you have to show further evidence that his """"highly charged"""" opinions affected his performance, the investigation, or the outcome in some way. You have NOT shown that. You are ASSUMING. 

&gt;but that doesnt mean they are not impartial!

Sending text messages does not mean an agent is altering or affecting the investigation. Having opinions does not mean an agent is altering or affecting the investigation. Once again, you're making assumptions which aren't supported by evidence. 

&gt; I'm following very reasonable lines of thought and making basic assumptions. 

You're bringing up facts and then making assumptions which lead you to conclusions which aren't necessarily true.

I am posting raw text messages from the source. Literally the exact opposite of cherry picked information for propaganda purposes. Thats why I link the raw data with all of the texts, so people can read and judge for themselves. You on the other hand, posted a CNN article calling them completely """"debunked"""" because a unnamed source says we need context. Thats called actual propaganda ya goof.



And exactly how am I miss-interpreting and misrepresenting any data? I post the raw text and a exact link to the page in question so they can find the exact exchange I post and read the surround texts. You post a summary done by CNN giving no real information stating its """"debunked"""" when its anything but. See how I gave the information the page reverences and let people go and look at it themselves? While in your post its no information and blanket stating its """"debunked"""" is a laughably desperate attempt to get people to not look into it. 

Also by the way, this text message here shits on your """"opinated but not affected"""" line.

""""Consider whether it is more appropriate to call this a __ersonal_ or __rivately-owned_ email server. __rivate_ may denote a commercial email service, such as gmail or hotmail. Use of these private commercial services was widespread at State before and during her tenure.""""

And for your other comment, yes those misdealings within his staff could easily be the basis for a warrant. On the offending persons not Trump. If page is suspected of something investigate that. But what happened is someone saw this, took the dossier and used it for blanket surveillance on the whole team. And then subsequently took that surveillance and had somebody un-redact all the names (thats a big deal in FISA) put all the info on spread sheets and pass it around like they were putting out flyers a house party. 

If the investigation was done properly I really would have no issue. If they got the warrant recorded everything and the information stayed within the proper circle and the names remained redacted until they found probable cause I would have no problem. My problem is that I believe they created this """"probable"""" cause to get full surveillance on Trump himself and his team and used the same manufactured evidence as basis to remove the safeguards from the FISA program (redacted names). And then once they found no more probable cause they took the very same manufactured evidence and used it as basis for a special counsel.

1083,"Here.

TL;DR - The explosive part of the memo is that Comey, Yates, McCabe, and Rosenstein 100% knew that the dossier was funded by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign, yet failed to disclose that piece of information to the FISA courts so that all relevant information could be weighed. It is particularly noteworthy that this happened on 4 occasions as the FISA warrant was re-extended 3 additional times (which includes even when Trump was not just President elect, but US President) and each time they failed to disclose to the court the sourcing of the intelligence, which likely would have played a role in their decision to authorize surveillance of Carter Page, and ultimately, the Trump campaign.

Also, one of the major problems pointed out here that is insanely damning, that I think a lot of people may be glossing over, is how they presented evidence to the FISA courts for re-authorization. FBI/DOJ actually used a Yahoo News article as evidence of a 2nd source corroborating the dossier. Here is the problem... Apparently Fusion GPS is the one that fed that story to Yahoo News. So in essence, it was Christopher Steele corroborating his own work. Here's the second problem, apparently they knew that Fusion GPS fed that story to Yahoo news, yet still used it was an evidence for re-authorization of the FISA warrant, as they continued to package and present the intelligence as their own, not coming from a partisan oppo research firm.

Another thing of particular note as well is that it does seem a bit more obvious as to the why, going back a few months ago, the FBI, the DoJ, and even many in the Democrat party were fighting to stop the information coming out on who funded the dossier. Well, turns out the FISA court not being told this piece of information is a bad thing.

If you think about it, if the sole source of the intelligence is from a lone biased party, you tend to want to weight the information a little better, possibly vet it and verify it yourself. The problem here is the memo shows the FBI was not able to do that, but they still packaged up the """"intel"""" as their own, removed that it came from oppo research of a political party, and presented it to get FISA warrants. I'll probably get downvoted for pointing out the inconvenient truth that this is insanely damning and looks very bad.

I will say that this memo was way the hell hyped up to be the be all end all of government corruption, and I am sure that many people here will dismiss it, but one thing that I will admit also looks pretty bad is the fact the the memo mentions that Steele had a falling out with the FBI for lying to them, so they discontinued talking to him as he was leaking information to the press, under the direction of Fusion GPS, whilst the FBI was trying to keep the dossier quiet so they could vet it and verify the intelligence themselves. So, Steele leaked info to the press on the dossier, which upset the FBI, and then Steele lied about it. So, Steele lost favor with the FBI.

Here is the catch... Fusion GPS still continued to funnel information to the FBI through a new liaison, Bruce Ohr of the DoJ. Ohr's wife was a senior executive for Fusion GPS, so whilst the FBI was no longer taking Christopher Steele's calls, Ohr was taking all of the information from Fusion GPS and giving it to the FBI himself, thus continuing to have the dossier essentially used as evidence further. The problem is that it seems the FBI didn't do much to verify any of that information at all, just accepted it as fact, bundled it up nicely as their own intelligence report, even though it came from oppo research of a political campaign, and misled the court of its origin. It definitely looks bad even though people will try to downplay it here, most likely. It particularly looks bad because apparently these senior FBI and DOJ officials knew where the intelligence was coming from, but decided to package it to the FISA court as if it was intelligence from themselves. This could be argued as an intent to deceive the FISA courts. At the very least, it's extremely likely there is going to be some major lawsuits that come out of this.

The memo does very little to address anything to do with Stokh and Page, if anyone was wondering, though it does mention them meeting with Andrew McCabe to talk about an """"insurance policy"""" against Trump, which again, definitely sounds bad.

Final brief thoughts on why this is bad for McCabe and especially for Comey:

Remember when Comey testified before Congress that the dossier was, and I quote exactly, """"... salacious and unverified,"""" telling Congress his thoughts on the whole dossier as not being reliable and some things completely false? Well, according to this memo, Comey's own signature signs off on the FISA application, using this dossier as evidence, to obtain surveillance warrant. He can't have it both ways. He can't tell Congress it's tabloid quality stuff, salacious, unverified and so on, but then sign off on it being used to obtain a FISA warrant? That seems pretty bad.


Spin that bro..





This reveals that the investigation into links between Russia and the Trump campaign violated some of the most cherished principles of our democracy, namely:

&gt;That a court may not consider an individual piece of evidence in deciding an issue unless that piece of evidence, standing alone, proves the issue to the point of absolute epistemological certainty.

&gt;That an investigation may only be conducted by individuals that view the investigation's target favorably and agree with that target politically.

&gt;That a court must reject evidence provided in support of a warrant where the source of the evidence does not support the election to the presidency of the investigation's target.

2. Even if it had started from opposition research, why would that matter? Finding out if there was truth to a claim is 100% what investigations are about in all cases right? If a girl claimed to be raped by an ex, you wouldn't just say, """"well she doesn't like him so no investigation."""" It would be entirely about what evidence you found while investigating the claims. And now there is so much evidence. 

3. Even without an investigation Jared Kushner straight up publicly released emails in which he commits a crime. Michael Flynn pleaded guilty. Manafort is clearly going to jail. Papadopoulos couldn't be more guilty and also pleaded guilty. Clearly investigation made sense.

Here's the primer I wrote collected entirely from publicly available firsthand sources. 


***


## What we know for certain - Evidence of felonies and abuse of power with only primary sources

###The Crime
What is claimed is that members of the Trump campaign **conspired to accept a thing of value from a foreign national**. Another claim is that **Currently, Jared Kushner is is violation of federal law and committed a felony in his assumption of position**. And finally **Donald Trump is abusing his power as president to obstruct justice in the investigation of these matters**. 

- With conspiracy laws (the legal term for collusion), the crime itself is the agreement to commit a crime - [1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/conspiracy) [2](https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?typed=Conspiracy&amp;type=1) [3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_(criminal)). This would normally be hard because it requires knowing intention to some degree. We have that. 

- Jared Kushner tweeted his own campaign emails. These emails were corroborated by Don Trump Jr. in a separate tweet. Both man have stated publicly that these tweets were real and from them. 

- In these tweeted images, Kusher states his intention and frame of mind plainly in the first image as, """"[The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was political opposition research... I decided to take the meeting](https://twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr/status/884789418455953413)"""" We now know that Kushner and Don Jr. believed the meeting to be about a thing of value, political opposition research. And made an attempt to meet. 

- If his testimony included the statement that this meeting was to rebuke the offer, it wouldn't be collusion. His testimony is that they had the meeting and the Intel was instead a [conversation about child adoption and the Magnitsky act](https://twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr/status/884789418455953413?lang=en).  If the info wasn't delivered, the legal term is *ineffectual collusion*. It is a crime.

- The child adoption and [Magnitsky Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/6156) are about sanctions on Putin and his response for which [Putin has attempted to blackmail and bribe politicians into dropping in the past](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3901780/07-26-17-Bill-Browder-Testimony.pdf)

- Federal election law says [a foreign national cannot contribute a thing of value to a campaign](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/11/110.20). The thing of value is the opposition research. It's well established that this is something that people might pay for and the email makes it clear that the Trump campaign, """"[like it very much](https://twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr/status/884789418455953413?lang=en)"""". [Trump himself even publicly asked for the Russians to steal it](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N1MbFesSC7M). Which we've established it is illegal. 

- Despite producing evidence himself that Kushner lied on his own [top secret clearance disclosure forms](https://www.state.gov/m/ds/clearances/60321.htm) - a felony. And yet Kushner still has that clearance and his job because his father in law is Trump. This is an ongoing abuse of power. It is happening right now.

1124,"The author of the Dossier isn't a nobody, he was picked for a very specific reason. Paying someone to write complete bullshit would be absolutely pointless, but paying someone with privileged information to be able to convincingly start with truth and take sharp turn into bullshit would be useful simply so people can take the line you chosen. Its the same exact tactic the pepe pizza crowd boys take when trying to misconstrue truths and take it to the conclusion they WANT. 

And this is the exact reason why burden of proof is solely on the accuser. The only things corroborated are the points of origin in the story. The parts that haven't are ANY of the crimes or salacious accusations against Trump. 

But yeah sure Ill address the rest of you r comment. 


&gt;Why do you think the FISA court had no corroborating evidence? 

The fact they had to corroborate the dossier with a yahoo news story. If they had ANYTHING else other then that it would of been used first.

IT WAS INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING AND INCOMPLETE WHICH IS WHY EVERYONE OUTSIDE THE CULT OF TRUMP URGED IT TO BE WITHHELD. 

I cannot for the life of me wrap my head around the official GOP story, which involves so many brain contortions and circular logic it makes your head hurt, when the truth is so much simpler: Trump and the Russians are great buds dating back from when the Russians bailed him out of the real estate collapse. While he was radioactive to US banks and none of them would lend him a dime, he got dough from the Russians. His idiot sons have admitted this in numerous appearances and interviews before the election. Remember when Don Jr. said """"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia""""? In exchange, he let them launder all sorts of dirty money through his foreign developments (check out the Trump Panama Tower and the shady cast of characters who bought units there, which is now a ghost-town. Then check out Trump Azerbaijan. Then check out the Russian dude who paid $100 million for a Trump Florida estate appraised at $40 million, then tore it down and never did anything with the land. People don't just do that for fun). They're all fronts for money laundering, which incidentally is part of the Manafort indictment).  

So then Trump decides he's going for it - running for Prez. He has all sorts of Russian buds who tell him they can help him - they have a sophisticated cyber operation and are pretty fucking expert at creating propaganda. Of course Trump says sure, because he's a narcissistic asshole and doesn't care about petty little things like """"laws"""". In exchange for their help, Putin wants sanctions lifted or unenforced. You know, """"adoptions"""" (ie the Magnitsky act, which has Russian assets frozen all over the world and has been a real thorn in the side of Putin &amp; his buddies). 

This whole thing is about money laundering in exchange for sanctions relief. Putin doesn't give a cold tin fuck about Trump - probably thinks he's a complete fucking idiot like the rest of the world. But he's a useful idiot, and if America can rip itself apart from within over the election of this ignoramus buffoon, even better for Russia.

How the fuck are you going to say this to me right after making this giant word jumble without a single paragraph break?



&gt;It is reality buddy. Think about what has been HAPPENING for the last 2 years how many voices they have been trying to silence. That us not FREEDOM it is a huge in your face violation of your 1st Amendment to free speech and not being neutral. The name Net Neutrality is a giant fake out, a con! The only things they should have any kind of say in stopping dangerous content is putting online any child pornography, murder, rape, or radical terrorism not political or religious views (and I am not a religious person nor do I practice any religion whatsoever but will fight for your right to not silence you.... because our Constitution gives you the inalienable right to not be persecuted based on your religion! And not letting you speak you mind violates our freedom of religion and is persecution. We have got to stop Google and our govt from chipping away at our 1st, 2nd, and 4th Amendment rights. Why do we think we left England...for religious freedom and to be taxed only if we are represented which is a whole other convo. The writers of our sacred Constitution were brilliant as they knew how corrupt men were and knew this day might come when they pushed to change things IN the Constitution. There was only one time where they opened up the Constitition to change it and that was when they added the Bill of Rights. So that us how we got the 12 Amendments...not to change the original Constitution. We, each, American needs to read the Constitution and really understand how it affects your daily life. It is an amazing document and I am incredibly thankful for living in a country that guarantees things so basic and so important for all free people. As an American woman although I can moan and groan about not making as much as my fellow American man all the really important stuff makes that seem shallow and pales in comparison to all the wonderful things I have because of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. So thank you James Madison.. The only things that should """"change"""" in the Constitution are things that can be ADDED that are good for all people not take away what is there or change verbiage to satisfy a religious or political viewpoint. It has worked for over 200 years. The Convention of States will finally stop ANYONE from making changes to the original document or changing the Amendments based on how the political winds are blowing. How would we like it if they changed our right to free speech and make that freedom only for those who believed in speech that didn't offend the guy deciding on the change. Like I said, when you have corrupt people in charge there must be a way to stop them from ever being able to make changes to what we have already. There should be a vehicle to add to our rights or to take away more govt controls and that is it! No other reason to mess with it. Our govt is using our children to force us to let them change the 2nd Ammendment. Believe it that the school shootings are planned and carried out by our gov't making sure the sick people they use are well armed. The fact that they were informed about this guyby more than one petson speaks volumes... and tells me that not acting on ijntelligence means they are in on it.

1152,"Lets start with matter of fact statements that are pretty universally accepted as not being misleading. 


&gt;the dossier started as oppo research from a conservative website.

&gt;After Trump emerged as the probable Republican nominee, attorney Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm retained American research firm Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research about Trump on behalf of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton presidential campaign.

&gt;Fusion GPS later contracted Steele to compile the dossier. Following Trump's election as president, funding from the Democrats ceased, but Steele continued working on the report, with financing coming directly from Glenn R. Simpson of Fusion GPS. The completed dossier and its information was then passed on to British and American intelligence services

These are not really up for debate, its all verifiable fact. Now lets move onto the """"allegations"""" contained in the Nunes memo.

&gt;The memo__ more compelling charge is that the FBI did present corroborating evidence for the Steele dossier__ claims _ but that said evidence consisted primarily of a Yahoo News article that was based on information leaked by Christopher Steele. If this is true _ and if the Steele dossier and Yahoo News article really did constitute the entirety of the FBI__ case _ then it appears that the Bureau misled the FISA court, and an American citizen was unfairly subjected to state surveillance.



You have to understand, when this all started Steele was a prestigious British spy and Kremlin expert working on his own accord because of the troubling information he found. As more and more comes out its revealed to us that this man is not only a outspoken never trumper but directly paid by Hillary and her team. Can you see where we might find that a little bit troubling? Not only is it paid opposition research there was a coordinated effort to hide that fact from the public. 

So the very same people who are blaming the loss of their billion dollar cant lose campaign on Russia are the ones paying and directing what steele writes. There is 10 figure motive for them not to do research but to find the conclusion they want. Same with their servers, they refused the FBI access and then paid a private company.

But what really gets me is the act of corroborating it with the yahoo news story. Because if that is truthful it shows almost unequivocally its all bullshit, or they would be able to give actual evidence instead of this circular reporting being used as evidence. 

Its far from a conspiracy theory and you should at-least understand how the other side sees it from their perspective. 

I think what we can agree on at this point is that we both need MORE information and really shouldn't be mad at each-other. The powers at be are trying their hardest to manipulate one way or another and we should just come together and demand real answers.

Hillary's body count, hillary selling uranium to russia, pizzagate, nunes' """"unmasking"""" scandal, the seth rich thing, the 400lb hacker laying on his bed, etc. 

There is one narrative that has enough evidence behind it to garner a serious, sustained investigation by the FBI/Special Council - that's the Russia investigation. It's so credible that the only way Trump supporters like yourself can remain in disbelief is by creating another fake narrative that suggests that somehow the FBI, Hillary, the DNC, huge parts of the """"deep state"""" and others are all working together to fabricate a year-and-a-half long investigation to hamstring Trump. It's literally a conspiracy theory. 

The only way to maintain your narrative in the face of the known facts is to weave this conspiracy theory. Why is the FBI still investigating the Trump thing if Trump says it's BS? Oh, because it's the FBI that's wrong, not Trump.

And if reporting is to be believed, the memo is centered around the Page warrant alone. Even if you take the dossier out of the picture, it's very clear that the warrant was justified:

* Carter Page previously admitted to giving documents to the SVR

&gt;Throughout the United States Virgin Islands, high winds, gusting up to 69 mph (111 km/h),[97] and heavy rains, peaking at 3.02 in (77 mm) on St. Thomas,[98] caused significant damage to roadways and power lines. Many residents across the islands were left without power for up to a week as a result of the storm. Following an assessment of the damage, total losses were placed at $2.5 million, allowing the governor of the U.S. V.I. to request for a major disaster declaration from the United States government. This request was later approved by President Barack Obama in late September.[99] In addition to damage to infrastructure, severe losses were sustained in the business sector. As a result of Earl's passage through the region, nearly 22,000 vacationers canceled their plans, resulting in a $10.7 million loss in revenue.[100] In March 2011, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) granted $555,219 in public assistance funding to cover the costs from Earl in the Virgin Islands.

So Obama sat on responding until they lost millions in lost tourist revenue. I mean fucking nothing. Where was the outrage then? Where was the non stop criticism?

Look at how Cuba, a communist country, and on an island, without the world's most powerful country is somehow recovering faster than PR.

For example, we were interested in the fact that the Trump family was selling merchandise under the Trump brand in the United States that was made in sweat shops in Asia and South America -- or Latin America. So we needed someone else for that. So there were other things. We were not totally focused on Russia at that time, but we were at a point where we were -- you know, we'd done a lot of reading and research and we were drilling down on specific areas.

Honestly I can see your line of attack after it is revealed they used opposition research to obtain FISA warrants. It going to be sure we used the dossier but there is also a ton of other super secret credible information we cant tell you so the memo doesn't matter. And you are going to eat it right up because you are a lap dog for these morons. 

Just remember how many times you people called me a shill for insinuating they used the dossier to get the warrants. How many times I was attacked and how your defense wasn't they had OTHER information, it was that they DIDNT used the dossier. Pivoting here to """"sure we used it but we had other stuff noone can see and that makes it OK"""" will not be acceptable and there will be punishment for people exploiting a program used to protect Americans to abuse them. 

For you to blindly accept """"there is more stuff we just cant show you"""" is absolutely fucking pathetic. Your flip flopping from no they didnt to its ok is legit depressing because I am slowly coming to the realization you people will never accept anything other then impeachment.

The Clinton trace comment.  I'll grant that this comment does indeed sound odd, except that if you actually look at the surrounding texts, it's clear that we don't have enough information to understand what it means.  It's a far cry from the smoking-gunness of """"Russia has just thrown the election for Trump"""" [1] or """"This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government__ support for Mr. Trump"""" [2].

Remember too that these lovebirds were hiding an affair, so comments about being traced could make sense.

Being annoyed by BLM protesters: many Americans, liberal and conservative alike, and in particular law enforcement, were annoyed by BLM. Wasn't Trump himself popular among law enforcement precisely because he supported """"blue lives matter""""?

Being annoyed by Bernie supporters: again, this suggests nuanced political views. Everyone would be upset with people who are yelling over the person they wanted to hear talk.

Finally, about them wanting Clinton to win?  If you were an FBI agent and knew of evidence that a political candidate was colluding with a foreign power to swing the election, wouldn't *you* support their biggest competitor?

How about the texts you don't mention, like this one:

#### BEGIN TEXT MESSAGE

  She [Hillary] was ok. B+

  Chelsea was awful. Tried to do Bills up close
  sharing. Didn't come across as genuine. Pius, she has a HORRIBLE
  billv goat speeeh tic

#### END TEXT MESSAGE

I thought the conspiracy was that Strzok was part of some left-wing liberal deep state?  These texts suggest they were actually fairly centrist and willing to criticize Clinton. The details all suggest that Strzok and his love interest had nuanced political views, not that they were part of some left-wing conspiracy.

I'd suggest sticking to a consistent story, except that that would be inconvenient to your conspiracy and your goal of convincing Bernie supporters that the FBI investigation has been compromised.

The facts point to either a conspiracy theory with an inconsistent story or a non-conspiracy with a consistent story.  Your choice. But you'll have more credibility if you lay out, fully documented, a falsifiable theory here.

 Redneck revolt shows up to provide an armed counter point (and first aid) to all the right wing militias which show up to __rotect the Nazis free speech_.

Your black and white view of antifa based on a few salacious news reports of anarchists breaking shit is not one which reflects the reality of the situation on the ground. The news reports on what is attention grabbing. And often anarchists show up st the same rallies that antifa does and they go to break shit (sometimes) but are not connected to the antifa organizers.

1281,"&gt; I'm making an honest effort here to not just tow the left's line, so let's have an honest conversation, yeah?

That sounds great!

&gt;I share text messages with colleagues all the time about how we hate our boss and wish he'd be replaced. It doesn't mean I'm actively sabotaging our teams productivity to make him look bad. I still do my job to the best of my ability knowing he gets the credit for it.

I get that they are human and have their own opinions as everyone does but these are very high level professionals heading a intelligence agency. They are required to maintain a very neutral political stance in regards to investigations. 

&gt;In the same way, these two could want a particular outcome (at that time you'd of course assume their preferred outcome was Hillary losing) but it doesn't prove they aren't going to perform their duties as objectively as the next guy.

Same as above, but it does appear they are not preforming their duties as they would normally. None of this seems remotely ethical or normal behavior for a supposedly neutral and independent FBI.

&gt;As far as the reference to """"Obama wanting everything..."""" This is impossible to fully understand outside of the context of the entire conversation, which we don't have. They COULD just have been overly presumptuous that one of their superiors requests for information was on behalf of the White House.

This is true, but Obama has stated on air that he has no knowledge of the Hillary investigation and has repeatedly insisted the investigation was free of politics and fair. So hopefully through more investigation we can get a better idea of exactly what they are talking about here but giving the rest of the text messages i know what way I would be leaning.  


&gt;And all that aside, even if they were extremely biased - and I'm not saying they weren't - if a crime was committed by Trump or his team, a crime was committed.

You are exactly what the Russians are trying to create with their bullshit propaganda. You are the end game. A population unable to have normal conversation because they have been radicalized to the point of seeing the enemy behind anyone who doesnt fall in line.

Its even been highlighted by the Mueller investigation themselves. They effectively preyed on the reactionary behavior and the deeply rooted spite in you people to be able to manipulate you. They effectively preyed on the lazy MSM to be able to amplify their message and even had lefty celebrities show up to their rallies. 

So how about we do exactly what they dont want and work together to sort through the huge amounts of bullshit getting fed from every direction and maybe just maybe we can cut through the smoke and mirrors and get a true glimpse of the reality of whats going on.

We had some tight deadline on getting the core navigational functionality (screen and state transitions between them) demonstrated, so the occasional little hiccup wasn't the end of the world.

One of these little hiccups would only appear every now and then when entering into a particular screen and state. Annoyingly every time I'd start to hone in on the actual bug, I'd come in the following day and no more bug, all working perfectly.

This went on for a couple of days until my boss gave the green light for overtime to continue to chase down the bug until found.

Turns out that there was a missing formatter in the """"SELECT .."""" the DB guys had plugged in for us on a date field.

By some stroke of luck, the default date format could be parsed correctly in the morning, but in the afternoon that date string became a """"... PM"""" which caused a weird date to be parsed, and then everything blew up further along because of the wrong date.

Really?  Leased cars are brand new, and if you're smart they are serviced and guaranteed for no extra cost.  Second hand cars will need brake pads, tyres, fluids, filters and regular inspections for signs of wear on more permanent parts.  All of that costs time and effort as well as money which, if you're unlucky, can quickly add up to be in the same ballpark as a lease anyway.

Yeah, it's *possible* a brand new car will break down and it's *possible* you'll get lucky on a second hand car with one lady owner.  But saying it's """"just as likely"""" that a freshly PDI'd model will break down, as that a £1500 shitheap from somebody's front driveway will, is a bit of a stretch.

Buy a second hand car, if you're worried about it being dodgy bring along a friend who knows about cars, or ask a local mechanic to check it over for you (they're usually happy to, for a small fee). Before buying, check insurance prices because London is very expensive for car insurance, even out in zone 5.

That way, when you don't need the car anymore you can sell and recoup most of your money. Generally, the less you pay for the car, the less it will depreciate.

I know they aren't interested in the business and I accept that their first priority is the child.  But that doesn't make it any easier on the business owner.

Would you take on somebody if you seriously thought this was going to happen?  Would any small enterprise ever hire anyone?  Equality is a nice idea but it will stifle small and slow growing businesses to the point where the only way to get started will be to take a big loan.  And that is not in the interests of the economy at large.

There should be a second class of job, which you as a company have to fulfill certain requirements to offer.  Low turnover (not profit) for example, maybe under 5 employees too.  Basically, a company with little reserve with which to deal with an uncertain absence of a large percentage of its workforce.  This second class job should carry with it either a waiver on the sexism discrimination policy (although this is completely insane and unfair to women who aren't interested in babies), a waiver on the ability to dismiss people for falling pregnant (which we kind of have in the UK given that in theory there's no unfair dismissal if it's in the first two years, although woe betide anyone who tries this out and immediately hires a man) or - and here's a wacky fucking idea - *some kind of increased government support in the case of pregnancy*.

Finally, a good 6-8 months after the birth she notifies the company she won't be working anymore. Meanwhile, she's been getting insurance benefits the entire time and HR is too afraid of a lawsuit to cut her loose. 

Her position has either been unfilled the entire time (requiring her coworkers to cover her share of the work at expense of their own lives), or if the manager is more prescient than most, has already been backfilled, but is still in a blocking pattern preventing other hires but at least not making coworkers' lives miserable.

Most users already have the .NET framework and for the other people the installation program will install it.

- IF you built a device that could prevent a plane from moving forward, regardless of the mechanics, the plane will not fly.
- You cannot build a treadmill that will prevent the plane from moving forward.

SO:
Hypothetically, if you could build such a treadmill (one so fast that the friction of the wheels counters the forward thrust) then the answer to the question is """"No, the plane will not fly"""".

HOWEVER, such a treadmill is probably physically impossible.

If you were using a 100% efficient motor and also using it as a 100% efficient regenerative braking system AND there was no friction or air resistance then your net energy loss from the battery would be zero.  Merely moving from point A to point B does not consume energy; only changing the velocity (i.e. speed or direction) or pulling away from a gravitaional or electromagnetic force costs energy.  Ferdinand is spot on (although I would have said 'altitude' rather than 'height' - deforming the car is a whole other problem).

It's only because our world is full of friction, air resistance and other inefficiencies that this is counterintuitive.  The implications are huge; a long space flight for example only requires, in theory, a big push at the beginning.  You'd then drift in a straight line for as long as you liked without burning any more fuel until something happened to slow you down or change your direction.

Also, somewhat depressingly, it means that when you cruise at a constant speed on the motorway, pretty much all of your gas is being burnt up just to move some air out of the way of your car.",t1_c03qo7t,pineapplecharm,3,t1_c03qn2r,c03qo7t,t3_6g1fw,t5_mouw,1208387440,c03qn2r,"I'm not sure what the role of the box is, but if the car starts from rest and ends at rest, and at the same height, then yes, all the energy supplied by the battery has been dissipated as heat.

The 100 J would be used up during the acceleration portion of the motion, during which some of this energy, let's say 20 J would be converted into the car's kinetic energy, and the remaining 80 J lost as heat.

First is a too-fast shutter speed; they're much more natural feeling if you have a longer shutter time which blurs the motion in keeping with the slow frame rate.  Ideally the shutter should be open for at least 1/10 of the time in between each shot; otherwise there's too much change between each sharp photo and it flickers unpleasantly, as this does.  Second mistake is there's nothing going on and no change from the start to the end.  Like /u/ugotamesij said, if we're going to put up with watching an old building in grey weather we could at least see some kind of progression.  But no, it's just some footage on a random afternoon.  There's not even an interesting camera angle or lighting scheme.

It would have been much better as one or two well set-up stills, at an interesting time of day (e.g. dawn) or perhaps when the weather was a bit less grey.  As it is, the only redeeming feature of this very dull little piece is the technical excellence of his equipment.

(Seriously, setting up email can be a pain. I've created an email server software myself and it's almost hard to believe the number of ways end-users can screw up their config.)

For users who have not installed .NET prior to running the installation program, my installation program tells the user that """"I need .NET, OK?"""". The user clicks OK, and then the installation program downloads and installs .NET without any user intervention. This is the part I consider to be easier than specifying correct host names and port settings in email configuration...The user just have to click """"OK"""". You could skip that as well, but """"expert"""" users may get upset if you install .NET without telling them.

Many (most?) program you can use to create installation programs already has such functionality built-in. Here's a tutorial/library which I used successfully (it's specific to InnoSetup).
http://www.codeproject.com/KB/install/dotnetfx_innosetup_instal.aspx

If the software is shipped on a CD-ROM, the .NET installation can be put in a folder next to the installation software so that the user doesn't have to wait for the download during installation.

Zenbook? lol. I like the Zenfone 2 (its better than the iPhone 4 that I had before), its only crashed on me **once** (stupid error made by me when updating) which needed a complete factory reset. 

I did install **Cyanogenmod** which bumped me up to the latest and greatest (compared to stock, havent installed 14.1 yet), so that accounts for some of the other random bugs I have experienced. I still wished Asus would put forth a little more Hereford toward keeping this phone updated, but thats something I guess I will live with. 

Overall, I would buy again, **however** toward the end of the year I may look at what Motorola/Lenovo has came out with for the $200-$300 price point since Asus's Zenfone line has became confusing to say the least, and if Lenovo can build phones like there Thinkpads-I would buy it just for that reason.

Then you've got to fuck around with Bluetooth pairing, install an app that may or may not be compatible with your phone, ensure both this gadget and your phone has battery, find room for another charger.

In his 5th grade class they play a lot of them, one-week units at a time, and he almost always ends up the class champion. But when he's in a high-pressure situation, he sometimes falters, and he really beats himself up about it. 

A few weeks ago, the game his class was playing was Pente, and again he's the class champ, undefeated. And one Thursday night the school had a big parents vs kids Pente tournament. Dozens and dozens of games where various parents play various kids in the class. This happens every year, and the parents haven't lost in over a decade. 

An hour full of frantic games pass, and with one game remaining, the adults and kids are tied, like 102-102 or something. And the remaining game that will decide it all... Whether the kids will emerge victorious for the first time since the Bush era... Is me versus my son. The kids are hyped up like crazy because they are close to a victory, and the guy they're pinning their hopes on is my son, their best player (who has already beaten me once earlier in the competition). They are packed around the table, chanting his name. But I can see... He is stressing out big time and getting super frazzled. And with the game on the line... He blows it. Makes a really bad move that essentially hands me the game, and the parents yet another victory. He realized it and I could see he was just devastated. 

So I just stare hard at the board... Fake concentrating as convincingly as I can... And pretend not to see it. Made a different play, he pounces and wins, the kids all go ape shit and he walks home on cloud nine, reveling in having stopped the parent win streak. 

Totally worth it.

This is what I was thinking of:

&gt; Under the pricing practices guide, administered by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, **the length of the new lower price sale should not be longer than the old higher price was available for.**

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23797882

Here are the full guidelines:

&gt; 1.2.3 As noted in para. 1.1.2, the basis of a price comparison should be reasonable
in terms of time, and what is reasonable will depend on the circumstances. But
where the basis of the comparison is not set out explicitly;

&gt; (a) A price used as a basis for comparison should have been your most recent price
available for 28 consecutive days or more;

&gt; (b) The period of time for which the new (lower) price will be available should not be
so long that the comparison becomes misleading. How long this will be will depend
on all the circumstances. But as a general guideline which could be applied to
cases in which there are no specific circumstances which might mean that a longer
period would not be misleading, **it is suggested that the period of time for which the
new (lower) price will be available should not be more than that for which the old
(higher) price was available**; and

&gt; (c) **Comparisons should not be made with prices last offered more than six months
ago.**

With more than six compartments flooded, Britannic could not stay afloat.

So actually the critical weakness of *Britannic* wasn't explosives but over-enthusiastic medical staff.

In scripts.js:

    }, 500);

Add a numerical offset or just grab the height from the header bar:

&gt;     $('html,body').animate({
        scrollTop: target.offset().top - $(""""#index-navigation"""").height()
    }, 500);

Also, I noticed you're doing a `return false` at the end to stop the browser from loading a new page/modifying the hash, but I'm pretty sure (and someone correct me if I'm wrong) that using `event.preventDefault()` is the preferred method for event catching/redirection. Which you can just pass in like so:

        event.preventDefault();

---

EDIT: One more thing, I noticed in process.js that you have several repeated click events bound to your handlers. Although it's really not a big deal, you could consider an exercise in modularization by trying to turn that particular repeated function into one modular method.

Give them all the same class, say `processItem`, then something like this:

&gt;     $("""".processItem"""").each(function(i) {
        $(this).click(function(e) {
            e.preventDefault();

2071,"It's a funny one.  I was glad to see them go, but this thread makes me want to be allowed to do as you suggested.  Funny how perspective works innit.

&gt;Rather an amusing thing happened while dressing that morning.  I was very cold when I got back into the boat, and, in my hurry to get my shirt on, I accidentally jerked it into the water.  It made me awfully wild, especially as George burst out laughing.  I could not see anything to laugh at, and I told George so, and he only laughed the more.  I never saw a man laugh so much.
&gt;
&gt;I quite lost my temper with him at last, and I pointed out to him what a drivelling maniac of an imbecile idiot he was; but he only roared the louder.  And then, just as I was landing the shirt, I noticed that it was not my shirt at all, but George__, which I had mistaken for mine; whereupon the humour of the thing struck me for the first time, and I began to laugh.  And the more I looked from George__ wet shirt to George, roaring with laughter, the more I was amused, and I laughed so much that I had to let the shirt fall back into the water again.
&gt;
&gt;__r____ you__ou__oing to get it out?_ said George, between his shrieks.
&gt;
&gt;I could not answer him at all for a while, I was laughing so, but, at last, between my peals I managed to jerk out:
&gt;
&gt;__t isn__ my shirt__t__ yours!_
&gt;
&gt;I never saw a man__ face change from lively to severe so suddenly in all my life before.
&gt;
&gt;__hat!_ he yelled, springing up.  __ou silly cuckoo!  Why can__ you be more careful what you__e doing?  Why the deuce don__ you go and dress on the bank?  You__e not fit to be in a boat, you__e not.  Gimme the hitcher._

2121,"It is more expensive to produce: takes longer and requires more malt to feed to the yeast.  But more significantly, there's more duty to pay.

&gt; **Beer Duty rates**
&gt; Most beers are charged General Beer Duty at £19.12 per hectolitre % of alcohol. For example, if you release a batch of 5 hectolitres of beer of a strength 4.0% ABV, your Beer Duty liability would be £382.40 (£19.12 _ 5 _ 4.0).
&gt; 
&gt; **High strength beer**
&gt; High Strength Beer Duty is charged on beer that exceeds 7.5% ABV and this is in addition to the General Beer Duty. This additional charge is set at £5.09. For example, if you release a batch of 5 hectolitres of beer of a strength 8.0% ABV, your Beer Duty liability is £968.40:
&gt; 
&gt; General Beer Duty - £19.12 _ 5 _ 8 = £764.80
&gt; 
&gt; High Strength Beer Duty - £5.09 _ 5 _ 8 = £203.60
&gt; 
&gt; **Lower strength beer**
&gt; Lower strength beer which is more than 1.2% ABV but not more than 2.8% ABV is set at £9.17. For example, if you release a batch of 5 hectolitres of beer of a strength 2.8% ABV, your Beer Duty liability will be £128.38:
&gt; 
&gt; Lower Strength Beer Duty - £9.17 _ 5 _ 2.8 = £128.38

2228,"&gt; Theres no room to agree/disagree.

Evidently.

All I'm saying is this: back in the day, a locked phone was, to someone without the lock code or the technical knowledge to hack it, a brick.  As you said, older Androids and iphones either didn't support voice control at all or didn't support it from the lock screen.  So the behaviour of locked phones has changed radically from being secure bricks to being something that, potentially, could run up your bill, give away your friends' numbers and hand anyone who picks it up a very credible way to impersonate you.  And that's not someone with technical knowledge, that's to anyone with a finger and a voice.

If that makes me a dinosaur, so be it, but it's still pretty shocking to me.",t1_ckwnlu4,pineapplecharm,1,t1_ckwn5cq,ckwnlu4,t3_2hsnuk,t5_2qh16,1412096966,ckwn5cq,"&gt; I'm still not sure what the significance of its newness is. 

I literally just told you twice, and I'm not the only one who has told you this. I'm not sure how this is confusing. A lot of brand new Android phones have voice commands accessible from the lock screen on by default. If your Android phone isn't brand spanking new_ as in_ manufactured in the last month or so, that it doesn't apply.

&gt;The phone I found was a 4, which suggests it wasn't exactly factory fresh either.

What does that have anything to do with Android?

Also, it couldn't have been a 4, as they don't support Siri.

&gt;I think I fundamentally disagree with you on that last point. 

Theres no room to agree/disagree. Handing data over to advertisers and making phone calls from the lock screen are two very very different things. Period.

&gt;I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that a phone which is locked is not able to make calls.

That's your opinion. In my opinion, phones shouldn't have a lock screen enabled by default_ and surprise, no phone does have a lock screen enabled by default!

&gt;I remember hearing that locked iphones could return a missed call when locked, which is actually pretty useful if you find a lost one. But being able to call any number from it? That's not the default expectation of the majority of users.

I don't think you are personally aware of the default expectation of the majority of users.

&gt;Just because you've heard about something doesn't make everyone who hasn't, or who wasn't expecting it, a moron.

Where have I suggested that it did?

My mom can't figure out her Android phone for the life of her_ like she can't figure out how to do anything, even after I've explicitly showed her. Before that she had an iPhone and it was the same story. She's not a moron, she just isn't good with technology.

&gt;You and I know it's just a setting but nobody I've spoken to about it has said, """"oh yeah, that's how I like it!"""" - they have all said, """"holy fucking shit, can I turn that off??""""

They basically keep you for a while and decide whether or not they want you in the end. I assume it isn't ALWAYS this decision process. Some families most likely know they are going to have to give you up, and may be doing a favor, taking care of you for some time. But in my case, every family would tell me (and my brother) that we'd be staying with them forever. This promise was never actually kept until the 5th home. I wanted to stay at all the homes actually. Moving was brutal as a kid because you had to make friends and start all over every single time. And I mean ALL OVER. It wasn't like moving today. If I were to get a job somewhere and move, I'd still be in contact with friends etc. Back then it was like """"okay bye everyone forever"""", which happened 4 times. It's like living 5 totally different lives.

(1.) Engage the customer. Nobody cares about your product. Take the pen, look it over and then very calmly set it down off to the side of the desk. Make eye contact and in the most genuine tone you can muster, begin asking questions of your """"client"""" and his pen needs. 

(2.) Ask good questions. Ask a lot of them. Make the client feel """"heard"""".

So I hear you're in the market for a pen?
Blue or black?
What kind of quantities do you need? 
What will this pen be used for?
Are you partial to a particular brand?
How important is price to you?

(3.) Make sure you have conceptual agreement, meaning, affirm that the client feels heard and probe just a little bit farther to give him an opportunity to bring up things you haven't covered. Repeat back his needs and then ask a couple insightful probing questions. It will sound like this. 

""""Well, Bob I'm thrilled that you've decided to consider purchasing pens through my company.

Price isn't a huge issue for the right pen but you of course want to keep an eye on the bottom line. Is there any other factors that I should be aware of? Is there something I forgot to ask? """"

(4.) Soft close him. A soft close is where you ask for his commitment to the sale without actually signing anything. Sounds like this. 

""""So let me ask you, Bob. If I came back to you with an offer of pens that  does x, y, z (list off his needs again) and meets your budget, is there any reason why you wouldn't want to move forward with this deal?

(5.) Finally go back and pick up the original pen and sell it to him.

""""I have great news bob, we just got in a shipment of high quality black pens that write good and feel great in the hand. The best news is we got them in at a great price so you can actually afford to give a few of them away to your customers as gifts.

HS will free up major lines such as the West Coast for an increasing amount of rail freight. Considering the base level benefits of rail freight vs. road freight, you can see why this is good.

Also consider the width of some train lines vs. that of major roads (motorways etc.). Once you get out of the city centres where all lines come together, railways are much thinner.

This version is for online release, we will make a few changes later on for film festivals. Our aim was to help the campaign and make a better understanding of the situation that is happening in the Undercroft but projecting it in a bigger light. 

These spaces, created by people as their own. Places that would of just have been left alone without no use., but are brought to life with these communities that use them. We wanted to show that these spaces, bring character to the city we live. Over taking these spaces with commercial use is not progress. Financially, it makes sense for the South Bank Centre to have retail units to finance their redevelopment of the festival wing. South Bank's view to increase the access of art is a good investment, but they turn a blind one when they are willing to destroy a creative community that have existed for 40 years... A space that could be argued that it already bring the South Bank stretch financial reward, with the people that come to see what happens at the Undercroft. 

Is it that the South Bank Centre doesn't view the urban activities in the undercroft as part of their cultural counterpart? Is it the reason that over the the Dalson Curve Garden is under threat, due to genrefication of the area or the fact that over the last few years, property prices have been rising, so it make financially sense to build flats...

Every people you interview will have a story to tell, your job is to manage how they tell that story.

If the bike is on private property, and you can remove it without causing damage, then yes, you can remove it and put it into safe storage elsewhere for the owner to reclaim.

If you have to damage the locks to remove it -- that's where it gets really difficult.

Technically, that's civil damage, and if the lock is expensive the owner might have grounds to demand compensation.

If the bike is there for several days though, you can argue that it was """"abandoned"""" and you are entitled to remove it -- but there is no explicit definition of how long the bike has to be there before that kicks in.

The law is frankly, in my opinion a bit of an arse in this regard. If someone dumps something on my property, then I should be free to do with it as I deem fit. But the law disagrees. As do lots of motorists who get terribly upset when their cars are clamped after they dump it on private property without asking for permission.

It's all a bit mucky frankly.

Also, I posted my experience in a similar thread...

_I use my pebbles with an iPhone on iOS 10 and it works great. I have also used my watches with an Android phone. While the experience is richer on Android, I am perfectly content having my pebble paired with my iPhone._

_As far as the richer experience, you have greater interaction with notifications on Android. For example, if one of your friends Checks-in on Swarm, you can """"Like"""" it directly from the watch. On iOS, that same notification only allows you to dismiss the notification from the watch and phone's lock screen._

_Also, on Android, you have greater control over the font size and can create customized vibrations for different app notifications._

_One thing I miss being able to do after returning to my iPhone was the ability to mute and unmute the ringer on my phone using my watch. With vibrations on my watch, I tend to mute my phone at work, but I often misplace it in my office. Using the watch to make the phone ring is great, but if the phone is muted, it's not very helpful._

Maybe they're just driving close to say get out of the way as you're too slow. If it's a single lane road, well then they're cunts but tailgating is not always that bad in my eyes.

Disclaimer: I don't tailgate as I'm paranoid about people slamming their brakes on, I don't flash as I think it's the height of bad manners and very aggressive but occasionally if someone is being really slow in the outside lane of an *empty* motorway and they haven't had the decency to move across after a minute or two, I might undertake but give them a lot of room.

2521,"Having compared the UK and US versions of the first book line-by-line (for work, I swear! I have a life really!) I can confirm there are surprisingly few differences.  Aside from simple spelling and punctuation (Americans seem to love commas right before 'and' in a way that set my teeth on edge) it comes down to:

* UK Dudley eats in """"hamburger bars"""" but his US version prefers """"Hamburger restaurants""""
* At the zoo, British Dudley's """"knickerbocker glory wasn__ big enough"""" but in the US it """"didn__ have enough ice cream on top"""".  I actually prefer the latter, and wonder if it's just a later edit.
* In the USA Sorting Hat scene Dean Thomas (the soccer fan) is """"tall"""" and """"black"""", neither of which is mentioned in the British. (One wonders why they didn't make him keen on basketball for good measure)

The rest is just the fifteen (yes, just fifteen) instances of """"Philosopher"""" being changed to """"Sorcerer"""".  I'm amazed to learn they actually bothered to film alternate dialogue without bothering to change the same lines in the books!

Edit: Looking back at my notes, there were a few other bits and pieces, such as adding little inline explanations.

* My AW feels like an expensive gadget that I need to take care of whereas my PTR just felt like a watch. I'm sure this will fade a bit as I get used to my AW though. It's especially ironic since the AW is leagues more durable.

* Pebble is very straightforward and simple and it's easy to memorize it so well you can operate it without looking, while the AW needs you to look at it.

* I'm surprised at how little I miss the watch faces on Pebble, but I do miss many of the apps: Rain was excellent, Snowy had great IFTTT support, Commute is way better than ETA, etc. I never thought I cared *that much* about apps on Pebble but turns out I do miss them.

* Not worrying about battery life. This is another that will fade as I get used to the battery life but right now I find myself checking the battery just to gauge how fast it drains.

The government lost patience and looked for radical solutions.

'Cause my source is actually seeing baby milk billboards when I was living in a third world country, and knowing personally people who were hired to translate for white-coated fake doctors, roaming the wards to sell formula to new mothers.  Argue all you want about HIV transmission, it's irresponsible to be pushing this stuff onto people in a country so broke it has a 60% unemployment rate.  Starvation or HIV isn't a great choice for your baby; being shit-poor while you scrape together the pennies for formula just heaps misery onto families ill-equipped to deal with it.

But hey, Cheerios are delicious, so whatever.

What beggars belief about Nestlé isn't so much that they were evil bastards in the 1970's - I mean, God knows Europeans don't have a spotless history in Africa, or the third world generally - but that in the Facebook era they continue to get away with it.  I saw maybe one person mentioning any controversy when the new Android OS was called KitKat but when EA charge too much for a computer game the front page loses its shit.  It's baffling.

Per chance, I happen to have explored the baby formula issue in-depth for school work and was surprised to find myself defending Nestle's positon given all the seemingly manufactured, one-sided, and blind hate towards the company. It was an issue blown out of proportion by a niche campaign that gained traction. Nestle's handled the PR extremely poorly.

There are many details to this opinion that I don't feel like writing out but the bottom-line is that I find the Nestle hate (again in regards to the formula only) was somewhat arbitrary and would make me want to really dig deeper into this bottled water issue instead of just assuming they are wrong.

*It's understandable that I'm taking some heat for not providing sources and the truth is I'm too lazy to dig up past school work I'll make a few points:

* I'm not a corporate shill. In fact, I'm the type of person to pay close attention to my consumption and I work in social policy. My goal in life is to work for a B-Corps because I beleive there is in fact a viable interesection between for-profit business and not just social accountability and reponsibility but as a social benefit.

* I learned this information from an MBA course whose entire intention is to instill corporate responsibility to students via case studies and discussion. In addition to readings, the lesson played out as a mock panel from both sides of the arguement including the state senator charging Nestle, Nestle's PR, an African victim and an African doctor. The information I'm going on comes from an hour and and half discussion.

* I ONLY know the details to the baby-formula issue and some of the most convincing evidence came from health stats (and I understand this is hard to swallow without evidence and that you would be right to not take my word for it), but I think there's a possibility that Nestle's involvement in Africa might have had a net benefit overall-we can not tell for sure because this is hard/impossible to track. It's easy to count how many babies died from lack of/incorrect use of formula. It's not so easy to count all the babies that might have survived from the increased hospital services provided by Nestle. Sure, they only gave money to hopsitals so they are able to push their products, but the ends might justify the means in this case - this is something that can be debated no doubt, but I don't think this is terribly wrong. Also, consider the fact that a malnourished or HIV stricken mothers, of which is not an insignificant population in Africa, would have had no other option anyway.

* There is a misconception that, as someone put it, """"White-coated fake doctors"""" roaming around pushing the formula on people. Not true. They were established medical professionals who were made to hand out the formula as a condition to recieve grant money from Nestle for their hospital, a condition which I am sure they were happy to oblige to. Whether or not you still think that's wrong is up for you to decide, but you must agree it is a far-cry than Nestle hiring actors masquerading as doctors. This is the kind of misinformation being spread around that makes me wary of the ardent protests against Nestle.

* I'm not asserting that there is no blood on Nestle's hand and that all their actions were appropriate, however I do think that there are plenty of injustices in the world being done by many other companies and that this scenario was no worse than others, yet somehow became the most mainstream. Also, I beleive that if no babies died, I'd have learned about this in marketing class as a successful campaign.

* The African community are not the ones who protested, much less boycotted. The issue originates and propogates from the first world who is viewing it from a different perspective than a third world country. Can we really assess what's right and wrong for a culture and life vastly different than ours? 

* This is a very loose analogy, but if what Nestle was doing was so wrong, what about the American fast food industry who thrives on the American underclass. You can say that, with their value menus, they aren't leaving much choice for impovished folks to stuff their faces with food which, after continuous consumption, will eventually lead to poor health. Wouldn't you think it weird if people in France, who has a different perspective that values healthy eating, starts protesting against fast food chains for what they are doing to people in America? Again, loose analogy, more just something to think about.

Although I have come to the conclusion that Nestle's baby formula issue is not as bad as perceived, ultimately my point isnt' necessarily to convince you of that. I just want people to stop and consider the ever-present fact that we may not be getting the full story. If you want to boycott Nestle for their unethcial baby formula marketing practices, then good for you, I would respect your committment. I just hope that it's because you've explored the issue and not because the issue is widely circulated on Facebook and Reddit.

&gt;I once ate a tray of 24 assorted muffins: blueberry, lemon poppy-seed, cranberry apple, banana nut, even bran. Large muffins too, like you'd buy at the bakery, not grocery store mini-muffins. I ate the first five or six out of hunger, and the next dozen I can only attribute to gluttony, but the last half dozen were devoured by determination alone. A part of me wanted to stop - I was full, the muffins had become repulsive, and there was a disconcerting pressure in my chest. The other, stronger part of me knew that if I gave up on that muffin platter I would admit limitation. A limited man can rationalize his every weakness, turn away from every challenge, live his life within the narrow confines of comfort; that's not how I live my life. But I digress. It took six days for my bowels to move, and when they did I shat a monolithic muffin block so wide it could not be flushed, so dense it would not dissolve with repeated flushing, and so heavy it took two hands to lift.

We went back a week later to have the stitches out.  Bob the badass hid on the parcel shelf of the car.  Then he snuck past three of us and had to be chased down in the vet's garden.  Finally I caught him and my flatmate and I (yes two of us) held him down while the vet whipped out the stitches.

The only thing I'd add is that writing JSON files as a data store is itself a chickenshit solution.  I think you should use CSV.  Three days spent writing file management functions for CSV will teach you the value of JSON and SQL before you even learn what they are.  Plus, you'll be the only guy at pretty much any company who's not shit-scared of CSV.

(* what I mean by that is, to install phpmyadmin, apt will fetch and install PHP, mySQL, Apache *and* phpmyadmin, effectively winning you a complete working web server with one line.  In theory.

If you want to improve your programming skills then a CMS requires a lot of useful concepts/features, DB manipulation, form processing, views, templates, html/css/js, authentication, sessions. You will be reinventing the wheel, but will learn a lot. You will have to put in a lot of work before you have an operational site.

If the primary motivation is to get a blog up and start filling it with content then deffo go with an existing CMS. Everyone has an opinion on what is better and I think they are all flawed to some degree. Key thing is not to get too hung up on the crap bits and get what you need out of it.

I use Expression Engine which I find flexible and has nice flexible content definition and templating. There is a learning curve and some terrible DB design in places but on the whole it does what i need much better than WordPress. For a lightweight site I have heard good things about [Perch](http://grabaperch.com/) on the node.js side everyone is talking about [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). I like the idea of static site generators (they do not create a page on request from a DB but generate all pages as a build process and output static html/css/js files), GitHub uses Jekyll which is a ruby based static site generator that takes mark down files as input. There are various other projects written in different languages. Take a look at [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo)
From experience if you can eliminate the database from your project, deployments, backups, merges all become much easier.

Some people were still rich but the majority of people really weren't so restaurant meals were an impossible luxury.  The market segregated into The Ritz at one end, the corner greasy spoon fry-up house on the other and little in between.

Enter entrepreneurial immigrants from India, many of whom had only arrived recently.  Decent food, served in idiosyncratic but classy surroundings by polite waiters - suddenly the void into which a working class young man's date plans had been mired was filled by a sensible option.  Ditto family outings.  Indian restaurants became a favourite mainly because they swamped a huge market that hadn't really existed before.

Now they're the most reliable option among sit-down restaurants that are reliably open late and have become a firm post-pub favourite.

Ok, I WAS believing you, but now I think you're just fuckin' with us! :)

Assuming you're for real though, I'm going to try to type this response on my phone...with the added distraction of a massive raging bone.

As a gay dude, it makes me so happy to read something like this. Not merely because it's hot, which I obviously would be a fool to try to deny, but because this is a HUGE PART of what we've been fighting for. All the marriage rights, anti bullying stuff, ending dadt, employment non-discrimination; it's not just for us gay dudes, is for you straight guys too. We want you to be free to do stuff like explore your sexuality with your best bud without being terrified of the consequences, without being made to feel ashamed for being curious about how good it feels to fall asleep next to eachother, without fearing what your friends or family might think if they find out, without even having to identify as gay at all for that matter. I fight for gay rights because by liberating one portion of humanity, it is something that I've always hoped would end up freeing all of us. I think I can finally see that slowly happening now and it's fuckin' awesome.

Happy for you bro, really. Have fun with your buddy and enjoy yourselves, wherever it goes. :)",t1_c2v4kt1,emanresu1,1292,t1_c2v4397,c2v4kt1,t3_lruh7,t5_2qzb6,1319788404,0.027093,0.576783,0.099526,0.240089,0.1657,0,0.445947,0.703837,0.092341,0.115708,0.492644,0.272443,0.15319443,0.6550221

2952,"It's pretty simple, although you should backtrack slightly first.

Instead of using tables, I'd advise you to change the two hour lists to just that - lists.  You could use a UL (unordered list) with each hour as a LI (list item).  Set padding and margins to 0 for both in the CSS and give each LI """"list-style: none;"""" to get rid of the bullets and """"float: left;"""" and sufficient width/height so they can fit the time text inside - the 100x100 you've gone for so far is fine.  The only missing part is to make #hours and #hours_remote float:left too and give them the property """"overflow:hidden"""" so that the floated hour panels don't wrap round onto a new line.  Make sure you give it a decent fixed or """"100%"""" width too.

You'll need is to put two days' worth of hours in #hours_remote as I said, for when you cross the midnight line.

Then comes the smart bit.  You stick #hours_remote into a div called, say, #hours_remote_holder, also floated, width'd and overflow:hidden.  Seems superfluous, right?  Well, when you calculate the time offset you just need to figure out the hour difference and then give #hours_remote a *negative* left-margin so that it moves to the left by the required amount, which will be hours*100 (or however many pixels wide each hour is).  Job done.

Obviously you'll need to write it so that you always move forwards in time but I'm sure you can work that out.

Best of luck with it; it's going to be very neat.

For what it's worth, there are plenty in southwest London I've enjoyed recently, at a reasonable price:

- Broadway Market in Tooting has two new tiny restaurants which are excellent: Plot and The Tapas Room. Both work off pretty short menus of sharing plates, but the quality is excellent. Tapas Room has a very good wine list too. I think we spent around £40pp all told.

- Clapham Common has a pair of restaurants from the same family: The Dairy and The Manor. Of the two, I preferred the Dairy, but they're both very good. Tasting menus at around £50pp, plus drinks/service.

- Near Clapham Junction you can find Soif, which is a restaurant specialising in natural wines. The food is excellent too.

2997,"I think the point is that people who tailgate rarely do it because they've forgotten not to tailgate.  They're not skillful drivers, they're already pissed off, they're being aggressive and the only way to get rid of them is either (a) to speed off faster than they can - and I do mean """"can"""" since they will often continue to tailgate you up through 100 just to show off how much you were in their way - or (b) to let them by.  Flashing brake lights, slowing down, waving, giving the finger etc tends simply to enrage them more and cause further risktaking behaviour like undertaking (although if they have room to do this, you're in the wrong) and so on.

Having said all that, I do remember being closely followed by a woman while I was on a driving lesson.  Being inexperienced I felt the pressure to keep my speed up and entered a roundabout faster than I should have.  Leaning over to change down into 3rd I missed and went into 1st.  When I let the clutch up the car almost stopped, and of course with no brake lights.  I was as you can imagine quite flustered by this but managed to limp through the roundabout and out the other side and when I finally remembered to look in the mirror again she was about 100 yards behind me and staying there.  So I guess that technique works.

In other news, I also did the IAM course.. in South Africa.  That shit was so nutty it's not recognised in Europe.  It had mandatory paranoia like counting your wheel nuts before setting off, and always having the doors locked.  My favourite was always leaving a car length ahead when in queueing traffic in case you had to book it out of there to avoid getting carjacked.

Got told that I should tap the brakes to make the lights flash if someone was up my arse; especially if we were approaching a junction or obstruction. 

Can't remember what the statistic was but apparently majority of accidents and insurance claims in recent years are from being shunted from behind, especially when the driver behind hasn't taken in the speed or stopping distance.  Got told I should put the lights on to remind the driver I was there or at the very least make them question why the hell I was slowing down.

We'd been at the London Book Fair and by the time we got there he was huffing and puffing and complaining like a surly child about how far we'd had to walk.  The moment we stepped inside, his attitude changed.  The bar!  The carved walls! The shit taxidermy!  The manual pre-decimal register!  He thought he'd been transported to fucking *Hogwarts*.  For years afterwards he asked after the place.

Still got a cab back to Earls Court though, the lazy swine.  And he sold """"The Time Traveller's Wife"""" to my main competitor.  Sigh.

Anyway, the Colton was great for years but it was never busy, and with only Queens Club to keep it afloat (and even then he was hard to find round the back) and no food on offer I had no idea how he kept going.
