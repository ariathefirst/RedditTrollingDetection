33,politics,t3_8e3f8u,PM_ME_UR_BOBSPLS,"&gt; First of all, that term, just like assault weapon, is made up and really has no concrete meaning.

Concealed Carry 101 - the ammo in this weapon ***should be*** such that it doesn't easily go through objects. This makes sense, yea? You don't want the shots that don't hit the target to go through a wall or object and hurt other people. Likewise, you don't want your rounds to go through the target and hit other people. ***If you don't have this type of ammo in your Concealed Carry you are as much of a danger to the public as the shooter.*** 

OK, so we got that out of the way. Now, whatever kind of semantic word you want to use, a weapon of war, a high capacity rifle, whatever, ***is designed to penetrate and kill.*** You don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand that these two types of weapons will work very differently in a situation. This puts you, the one with the pistol, at a distinct disadvantage. It's common sense. 

&gt; not if magazine sizes were limited.

Still will be stronger than your pistol. The point still stands. 

&gt; I have shot handguns, shotguns, and rifles. Personally I found the handgun to have more control because the rifle is larger and heavier, with a larger round size.

Great anecdote, but it's not helpful in a discussion. The rifle is designed to be easily fired and to give the user control. That's the entire purpose around its design. The longer barrel, the stock of the gun, all of it is designed to make the user have control while shooting. It's easier to pick up than a hand gun as well. ***By design.*** 

Think about it. Why do people use rifles like the AK-47 and M4? Their ease of use and durability is one of the major draws. 

&gt; That's not really helping your case, that's literally the reason why people are calling for a ban on rifles like these.

What do you think my case is in this discussion? I'm replying to your comment that suggests that the guy using the AK-47 is going to have a harder time shooting than the other guy with the pistol. That's just not realistic in any way shape or form. ",1524435400,t1_dxsmmth,1

63,politics,t3_8e3yoa,beckoning_cat,"I would  argue that the line is being blurred. It is not simply about purchasing  a game and playing it. There are a lot of independent game creators. Even for mass produced games, there are a lot of players who spend a lot of time creating mods themselves to completely change the game experience. Also  in a lot games you create your own avatar and it has been proven to be a psychological extension of ourselves. That is why Minecraft is popular, the creator created a simple  game and the players do what they want with the world, and then they made modifications to build it to how they want. The line between player and developer is getting thin.

When Second Life came out, it actually had its  own economy and stock market. It was completely player controlled with very little input from Linden Labs. People made careers out of online clubbing, sex, style and clothing design. It was so interesting that psychologists actually studied Second Life and used it for social studies in human behavior.

Guns are just a tool I own among many others and I dont think they have a ton of self defense potential. A have pepper spray for that because if I like spray the wrong person they won't die and kids won't kill each other playing with some pepper spray that I accidentally left laying around. I can't really imagine a lot of scenarios where my gun is easy enough to access 30 seconds notice but secure enough to be safe. Maybe some people are that organized, but I'm not. I can barely remember where I put my cell phone, in fact I don't know where it is right now.

Ideally I wouldn't even be interested in getting rid of the military grade rifles, but if people are getting killed too much then something has to change and I don't think adding a whole bunch of cops will really do much.

Maybe it's reasonable to think Society goes through various trends of Civility and violence and sometimes it's not as safe for citizens to own guns as other times. It makes it kind of difficult to read the limited amount of data we have on gun control.

It seems like back in the wild wild west days we had a lot of gun control and nothing particularly bad happened so I'm not all that scared of gun control and I don't find limits on gun ownership to be anti-gun. During prohibition we had a lot of violence and we use gun control and it worked. During the 80s and 90s we had a lot of violence and we use gun control and it worked. I mean it worked in the sense that gun crimes went down and the country didn't come for our guns and try to take all rights away just because we were maybe less armed or something.

Feel like the only way you're really anti-gun is if you're talking about getting rid of all guns and I am not sure what pro-gun would exactly mean.

&gt; Digital surveillance, including closed-circuit television and wireless infrastructure, in about 30 countries is so good that physical tracking is no longer necessary, Meyerriecks told the audience at an intelligence conference in Tampa, Florida, on Sunday.

&gt; In one, a small team &amp;quot;Took a bunch of unclassified overhead and street view&amp;quot; and paired it with machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to create &amp;quot;a map of cameras in one of the big capitals that we don&amp;#039;t have easy access to,&amp;quot; Meyerriecks said.

&gt; Digital cameras aren&amp;#039;t the only challenges, Meyerriecks continued.

&gt;The first Libyan Civil War, also referred to as the Libyan Revolution[34] or 17 February Revolution,[35] was an armed conflict in 2011 in the North African country of Libya fought between forces loyal to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and those seeking to oust his government.[36][37] The war was preceded by protests in Zawiya on 8 August 2009 and finally ignited by protests in Benghazi beginning on Tuesday, 15 February 2011, which led to clashes with security forces that fired on the crowd.[38] The protests escalated into a rebellion that spread across the country,[39] with the forces opposing Gaddafi establishing an interim governing body, the National Transitional Council.

&gt;How Syria War Started

&gt;Even before the conflict began, many Syrians were complaining about high unemployment, corruption and a lack of political freedom under President Bashar al-Assad, who succeeded his late father Hafez in 2000.

&gt;In March 2011, pro-democracy demonstrations erupted in the southern city of Deraa, inspired by the ""Arab Spring"" in neighbouring countries.

&gt;When the government used deadly force to crush the dissent, protests demanding the president's resignation erupted nationwide.

&gt;The unrest spread and the crackdown intensified. Opposition supporters took up arms, first to defend themselves and later to rid their areas of security forces. Mr Assad vowed to crush what he called ""foreign-backed terrorism"".

&gt;The violence rapidly escalated and the country descended into civil war.",1524434549,t1_dxsp4l6,1
